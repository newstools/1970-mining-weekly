JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Orion Minerals on Thursday said its Prieska zinc-copper project, which it acquired in March, has delivered positive results from its ongoing deep sulphide target drilling programme. Orion is targeting dip and strike extensions to historical underground mining areas at the project, with mineralisation having previously been delineated by extensive drilling and geophysics by previous owners. The current programme is scoped to systematically test and confirm the extensive historical drilling, with the aim of underpinning a maiden Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource estimate. Orion has also made significant progress with the assessment of existing infrastructure, in particular the reopening of the primary underground access through the decline roadway and the main Hutchings shaft.
