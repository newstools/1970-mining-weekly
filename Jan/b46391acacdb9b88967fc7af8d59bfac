VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-listed Centerra Gold has received its 2017 maximum allowable discharge (MAD) permit that lets it discharge treated effluent from the Kumtor mine tailings management facility, in the Kyrgyz Republic, starting in the spring. Centerra advised Wednesday that Kumtor now has all the necessary permits and approvals in place for continuous operations throughout 2017. Mining operations at Kumtor are subject to various permits and licenses, some of which are obtained on an annual basis, or for a fixed term. Centerra has in the recent years experienced delays in obtaining necessary permits and approvals for the yearly Kumtor mine plans and certain environmental permits, including the MAD permit, the permit for waste and the &lsquo;ecological passport&rsquo;. On December 28, 2016, the company received its 2017 maximum allowable emissions permit and its waste disposal permit, and the Kyrgyz authorities approved the 2017 mine plan for its Kumtor mine.
