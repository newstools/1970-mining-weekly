PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold miner Ramelius Resources has updated the ore reserves at its Vivien and Mt Magnet operations, in Western Australia, resulting in revised life-of-mine plans for both operations. An updated mineral resource of 854 000 t, at 7.2 g/t gold for 198 000 oz, and a new ore reserve of 525 000 t, at 7.3 g/t gold for 123 000 oz, has resulted in the addition of at least one year to the Vivien mine&#39;s life, which Ramelius said would extend to at least 2019. The underground operation started in May 2015, with the current mine plan spanning three years. Meanwhile, new ore reserves totaling 1.68-million tonnes, grading 1.7 g/t gold for 94 000 oz has been generated at the Stellar, Stellar West, Brown Hill, Vegas and Shannon deposits, at the Mt Magnet operation. These deposits, along with the Milky Way openpit, which hosts 78 000 oz, are included in a multipit mining proposal for Mt Magnet, which is currently before the Department of Mines and Petroleum for approval.
