JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash;&nbsp;West Africa-focused Avocet Mining completed the first closing of its Guinea-based Tri-K project. The company received a Presidential decree this month, formalising a mining convention for the project, paving the way for a partial sale to Morocco-based Managem. Avocet has now transferred a 40% interest in Tri-K to Managem for $4-million. Tri-K is Avocet&rsquo;s main development project, located near Kankan, Guinea&#39;s second-largest city. It comprises several exploration permits covering 490 km2, including the Koul&eacute;koun and Kodi&eacute;ran gold prospects, and a mining permit. Tri-K has an existing reserve of 480 000 oz of gold.
