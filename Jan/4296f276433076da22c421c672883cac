MUMBAI &ndash; Vedanta reported a fourth-quarter profit as India&rsquo;s biggest base metals producer benefited from a rally in prices and a special dividend announced by its zinc arm. Net income attributable to owners was 14.1-billion rupees in the three months through March and revenues were Rs246.1-billion, the unit of London-listed Vedanta Resources said in a statement Monday. That compares with a loss of Rs138.4-billion a year ago because of a writedown at its oil unit. A surge in zinc prices globally saw profit at unit Hindustan Zinc surge 43% in the quarter from a year earlier and the company announced a record payout to investors in March. Vedanta&rsquo;s billionaire chairman Anil Agarwal got another lift in April after shareholders approved merging the company with his Indian energy business, Cairn India, as he bids to create a resources heavyweight in the mold of Australia&rsquo;s BHP Billiton. A near $1.2-billion windfall from Vedanta&rsquo;s 65% stake in Hindustan Zinc and access to about $4-billion in cash at Cairn India will help soften concerns over its debt pile, according to ratings agencies. Vedanta&rsquo;s gross debt stood at Rs636.6-billion at the end of March, while cash and liquid investments were Rs634.7-billion, according to the company. &ldquo;Our strategic focus to ramp up production across the portfolio namely in zinc, aluminium, power and iron-ore businesses throughout the year has supplemented revenue growth,&rdquo; outgoing CEO Tom Albanese said in the statement. Record production of zinc and aluminium and cost management initiatives also helped the company boost profits, he said. Vedanta&rsquo;s stock rose 1.8% to close at Rs241 on Monday, putting it up 11% for the year. Zinc prices in London advanced 36% in the past year due to a shortfall in production of the metal used to galvanize steel.
