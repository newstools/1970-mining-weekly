VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Canadian gold producer Endeavour Mining has received a $47.5-million cash injection after its largest shareholder, Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris&#39;s La Mancha Holding exercised its anti-dilution right to re-increase its stake from its current 28.1% interest to its initial 29.9% ownership position. &quot;This additional investment by La Mancha, which has to-date injected approximately $190-million in Endeavour, further demonstrates its long-term support and its strong conviction in our ability to continue to create shareholder value,&rdquo; Endeavour president and CEO S&eacute;bastien de Montessus stated. Endeavour advised that with this increased financial flexibility, it is well-positioned to progress its upcoming organic growth opportunities, which include both the Ity carbon-in-leach gold process plant and its ambitious five-year exploration programme. Under terms of the private placement, La Mancha will acquire 2.57-million common shares of Endeavour at the 20-day volume weighted average price of C$24.62 each. The placement is subject to the approval of the TSX.
