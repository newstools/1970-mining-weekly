PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The board of lithium developer Pilbara Minerals has taken a final investment decision on the A$214-million Pilgangoora lithium/tantalum project, in Western Australia, with first spodumene and tantalite concentrate shipments scheduled for the second quarter of 2018. &ldquo;This is huge milestone, which marks the beginning of Pilbara&rsquo;s transformation into a leading global lithium producer. The final investment decision follows hard on the heels of our recent successful fundraising, reflecting our determination to deliver the Pilgangoora project as quickly as possible,&rdquo; said Pilbara MD Ken Brinsden on Friday. Pilbara recently raised A$80-million through a share placement, as well as completing a $100-million bond issue. A planned share purchase plan is expected to raise a further A$15-million. Brinsden said on Friday that following the capital raisings, the company was firmly set on the path to near-term production, against a backdrop of accelerating demand for lithium raw materials. &ldquo;We look forward to playing an important role in this new, exciting and rapidly growing industry.&rdquo; The project is expected to produce an average of 314 000 t/y of 6% spodumene concentrate and 321 000 lb/y of tantalite, over a mine life of 36 years. All project approvals were already in place. The project is estimated to have a post-tax net present value of A$709-million and an internal rate of return of 38.1%. It is expected to generate life-of-mine revenues of A$9.23-billion.
