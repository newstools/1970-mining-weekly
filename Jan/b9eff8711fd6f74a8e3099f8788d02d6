JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed IronRidge Resources has discovered multiple, significant outcropping lithium pegmatites at the historic Egyasimanku Hill lithium resource, within the Cape Coast lithium project area, in Ghana. Through a joint venture with Obotan Minerals, IronRidge holds the prospecting rights and the first right to apply for the historic Egyasimanku Hill lithium resource. The deposit had been drilled by the Ghana Geological Survey during 1962 and a non-Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource of 1.48-million tonnes at 1.66% lithium oxide has been reported. IronRidge on Wednesday noted that recent exploration at the site has shown multiple pegmatites with visible, coarse crowded spodumene aggregates, while outcropping pegmatites were characterised by coarse crystalline spodumene. Three separate pegmatite outcrop and boulder float zones mapped over 480 m, 350 m and 320 m strike lengths, with 20 m to 50 m widths open to the south-west, were also found. &ldquo;We are very excited to have located the historical Egyasimanku Hill resource, which further vindicates our rigorous and exhaustive research criteria. &ldquo;IronRidge is targeting the establishment of an integrated lithium business based on a range of high-grade resources throughout southern Ghana. We are very pleased with the development of our Ghana lithium project portfolio and look forward to keeping shareholders and investors updated as more news becomes available,&rdquo; said CEO Vincent Mascolo.
