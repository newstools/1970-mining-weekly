MANILA - Philippine Environment Secretary Regina Lopez said on Thursday she will ban open-pit mining in the country, part of her months-long crackdown on the sector she believes has caused extensive environmental damage. &quot;Each open pit is a financial liability for government for life,&quot; Lopez told a media briefing. &quot;It kills the economic potential of the place.&quot; Lopez in February ordered the permanent closure of 22 of 41 mines in the world&#39;s top nickel ore supplier for environmental breaches.
