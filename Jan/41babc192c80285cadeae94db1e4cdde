JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Stratex International on Wednesday reported that it was nearing the completion of a review of its 85%-owned Dalafin gold exploration project, in Senegal. The company and its Senegalese partner, Energy and Mining Corporation, have concluded a significant in-country cost reduction initiative and will be jointly defining a strategic approach to funding and progressing the planned exploration programme. Meanwhile, the company has resumed &ldquo;positive and constructive discussions&rdquo; with Bahar Madencilik, its Turkish conglomerate partner in the Altintepe gold mine, in Turkey, in which it holds a 45% stake. In February, the miner reported that it was considering taking steps to start receiving its share of revenue from the mine. Stratex should receive 20% of net cash generated by the project until the capital invested by Bahar Madencilik, has been repaid, after which its share will rise to 45%. &ldquo;We are confident that we are now in a position to achieve a successful outcome in relation to the joint venture relationship at the mine, in particular the due cash distributions to the company. The discussions between the [companies] are currently ongoing,&rdquo; Stratex said in a statement on Wednesday.
