JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX- and Aim-listed Avesoro Resources&rsquo; New Liberty mine, in Liberia, produced 14 906 oz of gold in the quarter ended March 31, with continued improvement in both mining and processing operations achieved. &ldquo;As anticipated, this was a 21% decrease on [production of 18 872 oz in] the fourth quarter of last year and is a result of the increased focus on catching up on the previously postponed waste stripping and the resulting lower feed grade during the period,&rdquo; the company said on Tuesday. Further to the 76% increase in total material movement achieved between the third and fourth quarters of 2016, material movement continued to increase by an additional 28% during the first quarter of this year to 4.3-million tonnes, of which 351 000 t was ore and 3.94-million tonnes was waste rock. This represents an increase of 54% in ore production and 27% in waste movement respectively and is a direct result of the operational efficiencies put into place by the management team since taking control of mining operations during the third quarter of last year,&rdquo; the company said. The New Liberty process plant operations continued to stabilise throughout the period, with 95% plant utilisation achieved in March. As a function of this, ore processed during the quarter reached 280 000 t, at a feed grade of 1.97 g/t, with gold recovery levels increasing from 88% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 90% in in this first quarter of 2017. &ldquo;The process plant is now operating in a consistent and stable manner and we remain confident of delivering our production guidance of 90 000 oz to 100 000 oz of gold for the full year,&rdquo; CEO Serhan Umurhan said.
