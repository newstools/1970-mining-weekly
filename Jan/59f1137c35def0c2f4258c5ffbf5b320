VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Base metals producer Nevsun Resources has appointed 30-year mining veteran Peter Kukielski as its new president and CEO, effective May 12, to replace Cliff Davis, who announced his intention to retire earlier this year. Most recently, Kukielski was employed as the CEO of Anemka Resources from 2014 to 2017, a private company backed by Warburg Pincus, which was formed to invest in global mining assets. From 2008 to 2013, he was the chief executive of mining for ArcelorMittal, responsible for 27 operating mines and three major development projects, distributed over 12 countries. Before that, Kukielski was the COO of Teck Resources between 2006 to 2008, responsible for three copper mines, four zinc mines, six metallurgical coal mines, two gold mines, one base metal refinery and two major development projects. From 2001 to 2006 he was with Falconbridge (originally Noranda) in senior roles, including COO, and in years prior he had various increasingly senior roles with other major mining companies, including direct experiences in engineering, commissioning and operating significant mines in a wide variety of international jurisdictions. Kukielski has an MSc in Civil Engineering from Stanford University, in California. Nevsun late last month reported first-quarter output of 3.3-million pounds of copper in concentrate and 51.9-million pounds of zinc in concentrate. It sold 66.5-million pounds of contained zinc in concentrate, generating quarterly revenue of $71.6-million, compared with $92.4-million in the same period of 2016. Net income fell to $2.9-million, compared with $15.6-million a year earlier.
