PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Strong drilling results have underlined the potential for the development of an underground operation at the Nullagine gold project, in Western Australia, ASX-listed Millennium Minerals said on Monday. The company noted that recent deep drilling at the Bartons pit had returned thick, high-grade intercepts, which would underpin a maiden underground mineral resource, likely to be defined by the end of July. CEO Peter Cash said the latest drilling results highlighted the strong potential for underground operations to grow the mine life at Nullagine. &ldquo;Nullagine has many deposits which remain open at depth, and therefore may host underground mines. Some of the deposits, like Bartons, are also free-milling, meaning they could provide a very cost effective means of growing our inventory and production.&rdquo; Cash said that Millennium intended to continue to systematically drill-test these opportunities, establishing additional resources.
