PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified miner Rio Tinto has delivered on its climate change targets, with the company having slashed its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by more than a quarter since 2008. The global mining group has reduced its GHG emissions intensity by 20.3% from 2008 to 2015, exceeding a 10% target that it had set. By the end of 2016, the company had reduced its GHG emissions intensity by 26%. &ldquo;We achieved this by raising efficiency within our business, and by divesting or closing emissions-intensive assets. In 2015, we extended our target period to 2020. Today, 67% of the electricity we source is from hydropower. The majority of this is in Canada, where we own 4 000 MW of hydroelectric capacity,&rdquo; the miner reported on Tuesday. In the company&rsquo;s first dedicated climate change report, CEO Jean-Sebastian Jacques noted that it was Rio Tinto&rsquo;s aim to be part of the solution, which he said could only be delivered through the collective efforts of business, governments and consumers. He pointed out that the company&rsquo;s products, such as copper, had a vital role to play in energy transmission and storage, borates in agriculture, and iron-ore and aluminium in urbanisation and transportation. The report noted that there was a need for large reductions in global GHG emissions to reduce the extent of future climate change and avoid the most severe impacts. This, coupled with the world&rsquo;s increasing requirements for secure, affordable energy, created challenges which were best met by companies, governments and society working together. &ldquo;Governments must lead by providing clear, consistent and effective climate policy frameworks. Level playing fields are essential for businesses to play their part. At Rio Tinto we support a market-based price on carbon. We believe this is the best way of achieving emissions reductions at least cost,&rdquo; Jacques said.
