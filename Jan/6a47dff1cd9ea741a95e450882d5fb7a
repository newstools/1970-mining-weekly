JOHANNESBURG &ndash; Tegeta Exploration &amp; Resources, a company part-owned by South Africa&rsquo;s Gupta family, reached an arbitrated settlement over a fine levied on its Optimum coal mine by power utility Eskom Holdings. The R2-billion ($144-million) penalty was originally issued to the mine&rsquo;s previous owner, Glencore, which put Optimum into bankruptcy protection in August 2015 after Eskom refused to amend an unprofitable coal-supply contract with Glencore and fined the producer because the fuel didn&rsquo;t meet specifications. Tegeta, a company in which both South African President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s son, Duduzane, and members of the Gupta family, who are friends with the president, have indirect interests, completed the purchase of the mine last year. &ldquo;We are not at liberty to disclose the contents of the agreement but at least we can say that the matter is now resolved,&rdquo; Khulu Phasiwe, a spokesperson for the utility, said by phone. &ldquo;Details cannot be divulged but the arbitrator has made an award.&rdquo; Glencore spokesperson Charles Watenphul declined to comment. Representatives of Gupta-controlled Oakbay Investments, which owns a stake in Tegeta, didn&rsquo;t immediately reply to an email seeking comment. &ldquo;At the time of this transaction, it was an insane coal price contract with an insanely large fine,&rdquo; Peter Major, director and head of mining at Cadiz Corporate Solutions, said of the Optimum sale. It&rsquo;s unlikely Tegeta would have bought the asset without expecting that the issues would be resolved, he said.
