JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; South African diamond miner Trans Hex Group expects to have widened its losses for the 2017 financial year. In a trading update published on Thursday, the group said it expects to report a loss a share of 173.5c for the year ended March 31, compared with a loss a share of 94.4c in the prior year. It further anticipates reporting a headline loss a share of 114.6c, compared with last year&rsquo;s headline loss a share of 56.9c. The JSE-listed miner said the widened losses were owing to a 19.5% decrease in sales revenue from its South African operations, along with R27.4-million in impairment charges incurred at its Lower Orange River operations. An equity accounting loss from West Coast Resources, which amounted to R71.3-million, including the group&rsquo;s share of an impairment charge to mining rights after tax, of R43.4-million, would also lead to the watershed.
