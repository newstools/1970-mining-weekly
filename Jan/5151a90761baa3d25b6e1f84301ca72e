PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mineral sands miner MZI Resources has secured $5-million in funding to progress its land access programme at its Keysbrook project, in Western Australia. The debt financing, provided by the company&rsquo;s major shareholder Resource Capital Fund, will enable MZI to pursue further arrangements with landowners for mining access in line with the company&rsquo;s long-term mine plan, said interim MD Steve Ward. The debt financing will be combined with a A$16-million debt funding package secured with Resource Capital Fund in November of last year, and will be on similar terms. The financing was subject to MZI securing a waiver from the ASX.
