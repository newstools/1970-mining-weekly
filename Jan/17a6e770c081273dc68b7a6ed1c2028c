JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The proposed sale of dual-listed Kibo Mining&rsquo;s northern Tanzania-based gold assets, Imweru and Lubando, to London-listed Opera Investment, is one step closer to completion, after the projects&rsquo; resources were upgraded. The two companies in September signed a heads of agreement for the unloading of Kibo&rsquo;s wholly-owned UK subsidiary Sloane Developments for 61-million Opera shares of 1p issued at a price of 6p apiece. Opera then commissioned Minxcon to undertake a competent person&#39;s report on the projects, which included an evaluation of the geological assets. The evaluation showed that Imweru hosted 2.36-million tonnes of indicated resource, at 1.19 g/t and 90 800 oz, while its inferred resource measured 9.24-million tonnes, at 1.43 g/t and 424 310 oz for a total resource of 515 110 oz. At Lubando, the study confirmed 6.78-million tonnes, grading 1.10 g/t and containing 293 870 oz.
