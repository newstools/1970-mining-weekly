RIO DE JANEIRO &ndash; Shareholders of Vale on Tuesday approved a share conversion plan, its press office said, in a bid to boost transparency, give equal votes to all shares and limit the possibility of government meddling in the world&#39;s No 1 iron-ore producer. Shareholders approved all seven items on the corporate restructuring agenda, which is a first step towards giving the company dispersed share ownership - where no major shareholder controls decision making at the firm. Minority holders backed the extension for up to three and a half years of an agreement by controlling shareholders grouped under holding company Valepar to maintain control. The assembly also approved Vale&#39;s takeover of Valepar and a subsequent merger of Vale&#39;s two types of stock into a single common one. Under terms of the share conversion, holders of Vale&#39;s Class A preferred shares who join the share conversion voluntarily will receive 0.9342 of common stock. To ensure completion of the plan, Vale would pay owners of Valepar a 10% premium for their shares, implying a 3% dilution for all shareholders. The former Valepar owners can sell the equivalent of up to 22% of Vale&#39;s common shares after a six-month lockup period starting in August expires, provided they keep a 20% stake by November 2020. The change represents a milestone in a country long hobbled by corporate governance abuses and reorganisations that hampered minority investors in most cases. Reuters reported the plan on January 19, citing people familiar with it. A simpler shareholder structure in which Vale&#39;s board, and not Valepar, will decide strategy, and higher liquidity stemming from the end of the Valepar lockup period could trigger a sharp rise in Vale&#39;s market capitalisation, analysts said. Investors expect Tuesday&#39;s vote will help improve investor perceptions of Vale, translating into a faster convergence of Vale&#39;s share prices to those of rivals, and a decline in the Brazilian miner&#39;s cost of capital. The plan also limits government interference in Vale - an aspect that weighed down the company&#39;s stock during President Dilma Rousseff&#39;s five years in office. Still, the Brazilian government will keep a golden share, a legal mechanism that allows it to fend off hostile takeover attempts and shape strategic decisions. The partners in Valepar include pension fund Previ Caixa de Previd&ecirc;ncia - currently Vale&#39;s largest shareholder - Bradespar and Japan&#39;s Mitsui &amp; Co, among others.
