MELBOURNE &ndash; Iron-ore shipments to China from Australia&#39;s Port Hedland terminal, used by BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group, fell 12% in February from the month before due to heavy rain, port data showed on Tuesday. Iron ore exports to China, the top destination from the port, dropped to 30.19-million tonnes in February from 34.49-million tonnes in January, Pilbara Ports Authority said on Tuesday. Overall shipments from the world&#39;s biggest iron ore export terminal declined to 35.67-million tonnes in February, a shorter month, from 40.30-million tonnes in January. &quot;The weakness in February appears to reflect heavy rainfall early in the month and doesn&#39;t reflect a fall away in demand,&quot; said Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O&#39;Connor, adding that rising freight rates and iron ore prices that month indicated a pick-up in demand. Cyclones and heavy rainfall typically stall shipping in the southern hemisphere summer months.
