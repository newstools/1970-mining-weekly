VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Effective from April 19, Madagascar-focused graphite project developer Energizer Resources will rebrand to NextSource Materials in an effort to better reflect the company&rsquo;s evolution from an exploration-stage company into a mine-development company. Management also believes the new name will better reflect its 100%-ownership of the separate and stand-alone graphite and vanadium deposits, the Molo and Green Giant projects, respectively, both of which the company considers as strategic &lsquo;energy minerals&rsquo; for batteries for the electric vehicle and large-scale energy storage markets. From April 24, the company&rsquo;s TSX-listed stock will trade under the ticker symbol &lsquo;NEXT&rsquo;. The Toronto-headquartered company said it will be providing an update &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; on the completion of the detailed engineering study for the Molo graphite project, which was initiated in January on the basis of the positive results of the front-end engineering and design study, which itself was completed in November last year.
