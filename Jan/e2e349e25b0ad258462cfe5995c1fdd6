PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed RNI has acquired the Chunderloo mining tenements from fellow-listed Westgold Resources. The tenements are part of Westgold&#39;s Central Murchison gold project, in Western Australia. RNI will issue five-million shares in exchange for the Chunderloo project, while Westgold will also release RNI from a right of first refusal held by the company over some tenements held by RNI. Westgold told shareholders on Wednesday that the deal represented a constructive consolidation of tenure for both RNI and Westgold, as the companies focused on their respective projects in the region. RNI executive director Debbie Fullarton added that it was a good opportunity for the company to cost-effectively add a highly prospective project that sits alongside its Bryah basin portfolio. &ldquo;We will move to quickly add value to this project by following up and expanding on the historical work that has already been undertaken,&rdquo; she added. The Chunderloo project has a non-Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource of 22 000 t, at 5.4 g/t gold and 1.6% copper. Mineralisation at the project is open down-plunge and a key objective is to extend the known resource while carrying out metallurgical testwork.
