SANTIAGO &ndash; Peru will likely gradually increase its copper production to 3.1-million tonnes in 2021 from an annual 2.35-million tonnes expected for both this year and next, the country&#39;s energy and mines minister told the CRU World Copper Conference in Chile. Peru surpassed China as the world&#39;s No 2 copper producer last year on the back of a surge in production from MMG&#39;s Las Bambas project and an expansion at Freeport-McMoRan&#39;s Cerro Verde mine.
