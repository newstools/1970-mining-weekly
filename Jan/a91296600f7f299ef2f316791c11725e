LIMA &ndash; No company placed a bid on Peru&#39;s nearly 100-year-old polymetallic smelter La Oroya in the first of three public auctions held on Friday, the head of the bidding committee said. The minimum price for the smelter and a small copper mine will be reduced by 15% from about $270-million in the second auction on March 21, said Pablo Peschiera, the head of consulting firm Dirige that is tasked with finding a new buyer.
