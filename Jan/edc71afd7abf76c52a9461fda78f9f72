SYDNEY &ndash; BHP Billiton chairperson Jacques Nasser said the timing of its $20-billion spree into US shale in 2011 was a misstep and that if the miner could turn the clock back it wouldn&rsquo;t have invested in the assets. The comments from Nasser, who will pass over the chairperson&rsquo;s baton to its youngest director Ken MacKenzie on September 1, follow similar remarks from CEO Andrew Mackenzie, who said in May the deals were poorly timed. &quot;In terms of shale, if you had to turn the clock back, and if you knew what we knew today, you wouldn&rsquo;t do it,&quot; Nasser, who took up his role in 2010, said at a Sydney lunch briefing. &quot;The timing was way off.&quot; The world&rsquo;s largest mining company has been been peppered with criticism since April, when restive investor Elliott Management went public with demands for a independent review of its oil division and castigated management decisions the fund claims have destroyed about $40-billion in value. BHP is considering further sales of its US shale gas assets amid heightened scrutiny of the unit from shareholders. &ldquo;We acknowledge that the acquisitions that took us into this business were poorly timed, that we paid too high a price, and that early on the very rapid pace of development was not optimal,&rdquo; Mackenzie said on a call last month. &ldquo;It was too quick. And we&rsquo;ve learned that lesson. &rdquo;
