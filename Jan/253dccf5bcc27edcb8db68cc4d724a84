JAKARTA - Freeport-McMoRan Inc said there will be &quot;no returning to business as usual&quot; for its giant Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, where operations have been disrupted as a result of an export stoppage imposed since mid-January, according to a company document dated February 28 reviewed by Reuters. Under a revised plan for 2017, Grasberg&#39;s daily copper ore output will be scaled back to 95 000 tonnes from a previous estimate of 140 000 tonnes, the document said.
