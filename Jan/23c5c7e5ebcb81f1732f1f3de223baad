PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The South Australian government has unveiled plans for a magnetite strategy, similar to its copper strategy, to unlock the 14-billion tonnes of ore present in the state. Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy Tom Koutsantonis said in Adelaide on Tuesday that the soon-to-be released magnetite strategy will emphasise to the global marketplace that South Australian magnetite was the quality choice for steelmaking. &ldquo;As companies share the plan with prospective finance partners, by inference, the strategy confirms that South Australia has a supportive government and environment as a long-term sustainable basis to grow this industry, and we should not underestimate the importance of this to the investment community,&rdquo; Koutsantonis said. The 2016 copper strategy had been aimed at tripling the state&rsquo;s copper production to one-million tonnes a year within a two decades, targeting accelerating exploration and discovery, improved productivity and efficiency through innovation, and maximising community engagement to guarantee continued public support for the resources sector.
