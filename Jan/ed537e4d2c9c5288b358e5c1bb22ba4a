JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The commissioning of Aim-listed Premier African Minerals&rsquo; RHA tungsten mine, in Zimbabwe, is on track, with the first shipment of wolframite concentrate completed at the start of this month.&nbsp; CEO George Roach on Wednesday noted that the plant&rsquo;s X-ray transmission sorter was exceeding expectations and proved capable of recovering up to 100% of mineralisation contained in the run-of-mine (RoM) feed to the sorter, on a continuous basis and in a mass pull of around 5%, on average. General refinement of the sorter operation and optimisation of the gravity recovery circuit and other elements of the crushing circuits continue with constant steady improvements. Breakeven production of wolframite occurs at 3 000 metric tonne units a month, with the plant having already achieved and exceeded this production level, but not yet on a sustained basis. Ongoing optimisation, refinement and mining development is expected to result in continuous sustained operation at profitable levels soon. Meanwhile, the miner noted that drilling continued at its Zulu lithium and tantalum project, aimed at increasing its interim maiden resource expected to cover a limited length of the so far known 3.5 km strike length. &ldquo;Drilling has been interrupted from time to time with ongoing and unseasonal heavy rains but this is now expected to end as winter approaches for this region,&rdquo; Roach said. In addition, Premier will start a mobile metals ions survey to detect hidden mineralisation in areas where mineralisation is not outcropping.
