PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; New data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has shown that the mining sector&rsquo;s contribution to Australia&rsquo;s economic prosperity continued to grow, with exports rising by A$640-million between January and February, to A$32.9-billion. The ABS data showed that exports of iron-ore were worth A$5.39-billion in February, an increase of 53% compared with February last year, while coal exports were valued at A$4.26-billion, a 76% year-on-year increase. Gold exports were worth A$1.38-billion, up 55% compared with a year earlier. &ldquo;While Cyclone Debbie&rsquo;s aftermath may cause some disruptions to Queensland coal shipments in the coming period, the latest figures show coal exports in the first eight months of 2016/17 have already reached close to the level achieved over the full 2015/16 financial year,&rdquo; Minerals Council of Australia CEO Brendan Pearson said on Wednesday. &ldquo;The increases in export earnings reflect higher prices for key commodities on global markets and the Australian mining industry&rsquo;s role as a major exporter to key Asian markets.&rdquo; Pearson noted that the investment phase of the mining boom had underwritten an expansion in production which, in turn, was making a major contribution to Australian economic growth. The latest trade figures follow recent research estimating that the Australian mining and mining, equipment and technology services (Mets) sectors together generated more than A$236-billion in value added, or 15% of Australia&rsquo;s economy, in 2015/16. The research also showed that the mining and Mets sectors supported more than 1.1-million Australian jobs, or around one in every ten jobs, in 2015/16.
