PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Australian Bauxite has flagged interest from new customers, with the company telling shareholders it had received a letter of intent for a &quot;significant shipment&quot; of cement grade bauxite from its Bald Hill bauxite mine, in Tasmania. The company is in discussions with the customer about delivery arrangement, with the shipment date expected to be early in the fourth quarter. &ldquo;Interest from new customers is increasing because we have a unique cement-grade product range and our reputation is spreading in an industry which is normally reluctant to change ingredients unless benefits are proven,&rdquo; said Australian Bauxite CEO Ian Levy. &ldquo;And all at once, we are also getting requests from metallurgical bauxite sales into China and India, at better prices than three months ago.&rdquo;
