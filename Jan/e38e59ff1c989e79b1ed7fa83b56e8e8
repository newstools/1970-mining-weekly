JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Irish gold explorer Conroy Gold and Natural Resources has received a requisition for a general meeting to remove six directors and appoint three new ones. The company, which is exploring and developing projects in Ireland and Finland, said on Thursday that a request was made for certain directors to be removed, including nonexecutive deputy chairperson Seamus FitzPatrick and FD James Jones, as well as nonexecutive directors Dr Sorca Conroy, Louis Maguire, Michael Power and David Wathen. That would leave Conroy Gold with three directors, including Professor Richard Conroy, MD Maureen Jones and nonexecutive director Professor Garth Earls. The requisition calls for the appointment of Patrick O&rsquo;Sullivan, Paul Johnson and Gervaise Heddle as new directors. According to the Conroy Gold website, O&rsquo;Sullivan owns 27.24% of the company&rsquo;s stock. &ldquo;The board is taking advice in relation to the requisition,&rdquo; the Aim- and ESM-listed explorer said in a statement. Conroy Gold&rsquo;s main project in Ireland lies within the Longford &ndash; Down Massif, where the company has discovered a new European gold district extending for 30 miles from County Armagh in Northern Ireland across Counties Monaghan and Cavan in the Republic of Ireland.
