PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash;The demand for ASX-listed junior Carpentaria Exploration&rsquo;s Hawsons supergrade product has significantly increased, with Taiwanese conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group increasing its uptake. Formosa has now increased its nonbinding letter of intent to purchase Hawsons supergrade product from 2-million tonnes a year to 2.6-million tonnes a year, for an initial period of ten years. Some 12-million tonnes a year of Hawsons supergrade product is now under letters of intent with blue chip customers across Asia and the Middle East, accounting for 120% of the output rate being considered by the prefeasibility study currently under way for the Hawsons iron project, in New South Wales. &ldquo;We are delighted with this new positive development and look forward to converting this letter of intent to a definitive binding agreement during our bankable feasibility study,&rdquo; said Carpentaria MD Quentin Hill. &ldquo;Given the strong customer support, we will look to configure the Hawsons project to maximise the output of Hawsons supergrade product during the bankable feasibility study.&rdquo; A prefeasibility study into the Hawsons project is currently ongoing, targeted for completion at the end of June, and looks at the development of a ten-million-tonne-a-year operation.
