JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; BlueRock Diamonds has commissioned the primary crushing and screening circuit at its Kareevlei operation, in the Northern Cape. The company has been able to operate full processing for up to seven hours, with the plant demonstrating hourly capacity in line with expectations. However, plans to extend processing to 24 hours a day have been hampered by high rainfall in January and February. This is likely to delay revenue generation and cash flow from the production and sale of diamonds. &ldquo;I am pleased to report that the upgrade to the plant is now complete, although the continued wet weather remains a source of frustration. The next step is to move to 24 hour production and I look forward to updating the market shortly in this regard,&rdquo; commented CEO Adam Waugh. BlueRock restarted operations at Kareevlei earlier this month after having halted operations late last year to undertake upgrades to the processing plant and trackless mobile machinery.
