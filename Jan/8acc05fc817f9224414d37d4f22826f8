PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Coal miner New Hope Group is seeking a judicial review of the Queensland Land Court&rsquo;s decision not to support the grant of a mining lease and environmental authority for the Stage 3 expansion of the New Acland mine. The Land Court in May raised concerns about the impact of the proposed expansion on groundwater in the region, recommending that the mining lease and environmental authority not be granted. The New Acland Stage 3 project will expand the mine&rsquo;s yearly output from 4.8-million tonnes to 7.5-million tonnes and will extend the operation&rsquo;s life beyond the current end-date of 2017/18. The expanded operation will see a further 260 people employed at the mine, and could inject some A$12-billion in local, state and federal revenues over the life of the project. New Hope said on Thursday that the company remained committed to progressing the approvals required to deliver the Stage 3 project.
