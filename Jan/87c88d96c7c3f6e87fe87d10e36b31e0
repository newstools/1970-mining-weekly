JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Very few employees at Harmony Gold&rsquo;s Kusasalethu mine reported for work on Tuesday morning, spokesperson Marian van der Walt told Mining Weekly Online. The miner on Monday issued an ultimatum, calling for striking workers to return to work by Tuesday night or face disciplinary action. The Labour Court of South Africa on Friday granted an interdict declaring ongoing industrial action at the mine unprotected and ordering employees to return to work. Harmony on Monday said it and recognised unions, including the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), have entered into various labour agreements since 2013. &quot;Despite reaching these agreements, AMCU and its members have, since the start of 2017, continued to disrupt operations, threatening the safety of Harmony&#39;s employees and impacting negatively on production.&quot; Van der Walt explained that the company would continue to communicate with its employees to return to work. &ldquo;We are also urging the families of the employees to speak to them, as their livelihoods are being threatened,&rdquo; she said.
