LIMA &ndash; An ongoing strike at Peru&#39;s top copper mine, Cerro Verde, may end next week if the labour ministry declares it illegal, the head of the union said on Tuesday after negotiations with owner Freeport-McMoRan ended without an agreement on labour demands. Workers began the strike on Friday to demand better family health benefits and a bigger share of the mine&#39;s profits, but they risk losing their jobs if the ministry says the strike is illegal and they do not return to work, said union president Zenon Mujica. Freeport-McMoRan did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
