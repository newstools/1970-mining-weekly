PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Nickel miner Western Areas expects its full-year production to be at the top end of its guidance, following a strong second half. The miner expects to produce between 25 000 t and 26 000 t of nickel in ore, and between 22 000 t and 23 000 t of concentrate. Western Areas on Wednesday told shareholders that unit costs for the full year would also be at the lower end of the previously guided A$2.35/lb to A$2.50/lb. Meanwhile, some A$9-million in expected sales revenue could be moved from the 2017 calendar year to the 2018 calendar year, as crane maintenance at the Port of Esperance could result in an export shipment not crossing the ship&rsquo;s rail until early July, instead of its scheduled export date of late June. Should this eventuate, Western Areas expected to report the A$9-million nickel-in-concentrate sales in the next financial year.
