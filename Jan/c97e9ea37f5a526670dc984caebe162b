LIMA &ndash; Workers at Peru&#39;s top copper mine, Freeport-McMoRan&#39;s Cerro Verde, started an indefinite strike on Friday that halted 95% of production of about 40 000 tonnes per month, the union said. But a dispute over worker demands might be solved at a scheduled meeting between union officials and the mine&#39;s management on Monday, said Zenon Mujica, the secretary general of the union. Workers want better family health benefits and a bigger share of the mine&#39;s profits, which Mujica said have risen on better copper prices and higher output following an expansion. &quot;Copper prices have improved, production has improved, but profits for workers haven&#39;t improved,&quot; said Mujica. Freeport said in a statement that Cerro Verde was &quot;operating and continues to engage in constructive discussions with the Union and the company&#39;s employees to address their concerns.&quot; The company declined further comment. The stoppage is the latest disruption to global copper supplies to put pressure on prices, amid a monthlong strike at BHP Billiton&#39;s Escondida mine in Chile and a dispute over export rights at Freeport&#39;s Grasberg mine in Indonesia. Nearly all of the 1 300 unionised workers at Cerro Verde downed tools at 7:30 am, said Mujica. The company had planned to mitigate the impacts of the strike using 300 to 400 non-unionised workers who do not normally work in areas essential to production, said the union&#39;s deputy secretary general, Cesar Fernandez. Freeport-McMoRan owns a 53.56% stake in Cerro Verde, which more than doubled its production of copper to nearly 500 000 t of copper last year after a major expansion. Sumitomo Metal Mining Company Ltd controls a 21% stake in the mine, and Buenaventura has 19.58%. The Cerro Verde union had initially scheduled a five-day strike but voted this week to stop work indefinitely, Fernandez said.
