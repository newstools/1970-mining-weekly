PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Queensland&rsquo;s mining equipment, technology and services (METS) sector has been invited to apply for the state government&rsquo;s dedicated late-stage industry accelerator programme, which aims to fast-track innovation in the market. &ldquo;Delivering the accelerator and other programmes that will drive METS innovation in Queensland is why we&rsquo;ve partnered with Australian Industry Growth Centre METS Ignited,&rdquo; State Development Minister Dr Anthony Lynham said on Tuesday. &ldquo;A commitment to research and development is a huge part of what makes Queensland&rsquo;s METS sector a leader, and the Queensland government is investing A$6-million over four years to help our METS companies turn their good ideas into commercial products faster.&rdquo; Queensland METS companies with a prototype or other well-advanced product or service have until the end of June to apply to enter the accelerator; a 12-week programme of expert mentoring, deep-dive workshops and exposure to industry experts, including potential customers, that will help them refine and commercialise their idea. &ldquo;The late-stage Igniting METS Accelerator will complement the Unearthed accelerator programme run out of the Department of Science, Information Technology and Innovation that was launched two weeks ago,&rdquo; Lynham said. &ldquo;That early-stage accelerator programme targets METS companies at an earlier stage of the commercialisation. &ldquo;Together, these two government programmes give any of Queensland&rsquo;s 800-plus METS companies with a good idea a real pathway to turning it into a commercial reality. &ldquo;The resources industry is part of the lifeblood of the Queensland economy. We know mining, we know gas, and we know the technology and services those industries need to thrive. This government is committed to seeing great Queensland METS companies grow, prosper and deliver jobs for Queenslanders.&rdquo;
