Britain&#39;s BT has appointed Jan du Plessis, chairperson of miner Rio Tinto, as its next chairperson, taking over from Mike Rake who has led the telecoms group for ten years. BT said on Thursday that du Plessis would join its board as a nonexecutive director on June 1, and become chairperson on November 1. Du Plessis has led Rio Tinto through a volatile period, as it scrambled to pay down $39-billion in debt from its Alcan takeover, scrapped a controversial tie-up with China&#39;s Chinalco, sacked a chief executive after the company made over-priced acquisitions and fended off a bid from Glencore.
