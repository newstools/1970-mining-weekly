SANTIAGO &ndash; Chile&#39;s state-run Codelco said on Friday that its copper output in the first quarter slid 11% from a year ago, as ore grades decline at its ageing mines, but an incipient recovery in copper prices boosted its profits. Codelco, the world No 2 copper miner, said output in the three months to end-March was 390 000 t from its wholly-owned mines, and 416 000 t including its stakes in other deposits. It reported a pre-tax profit for the three months to end-March of $534-million, which compared with a loss a year ago, and was more than it earned in the whole of 2016. The company cited the improved copper price - up around 18% since October - as a factor, as well a continued push to keep a lid on costs. &quot;The improved copper price does not allow Codelco to abandon its plans of saving and productivity. Its demanding investment portfolio depends on this,&quot; the company said in a presentation alongside results. Nonetheless, cash costs rose in the first quarter - up about 6% from a year ago to $1.34/lb of copper. Codelco is in the midst of an ambitious $18-billion investment programme to revamp and expand its mines and remain a major player. Its plan to convert its flagship Chuquicamata openpit mine into an underground deposit was nearly half complete, it said.
