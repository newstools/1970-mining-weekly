SINGAPORE &ndash; Shandong Gold Mining plans to apply for loans worth up to $1.26-billion via its unit to fund the acquisition of a stake in Barrick Gold&#39;s mine in Argentina, the Chinese precious metal producer said on Friday. The Chinese producer&#39;s unit Shandong Gold Mining (Hong Kong) would apply for the loans from offshore units of two Chinese state-owned banks, it said in a statement. Out of the total borrowing, $960-million would be used to fund the acquisition of a 50% stake in Canadian firm Barrick&#39;s Veladero gold mine, in Argentina, while the remaining $300-million would be allocated as working capital. In April, Shandong Gold Mining said it would acquire the stake in the Veladero mine owned by Barrick, the world&#39;s largest gold producer. Chinese firms have been seeking resources overseas to expand their global footprint.
