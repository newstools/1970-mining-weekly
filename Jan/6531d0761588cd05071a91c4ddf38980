JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Tanzania-focused exploration and development company Kibo Mining is reviewing pending mining legislation changes in Tanzania. The Aim- and JSE-listed company, which is developing the Mbeya coal-to-power project (MCPP) in the country, on Tuesday said it would continue to monitor the situation closely. Reuters reported that Tanzania&rsquo;s Parliament had passed two laws on Monday to allow the government to force mining and energy companies to renegotiate their contracts. A third Bill was also expected to be passed this week. In addition to the MCPP, Kibo also owns the Lake Victoria gold project and the Haneti nickel-platinum group element-gold project in Tanzania.
