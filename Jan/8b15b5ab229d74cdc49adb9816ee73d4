JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; JSE-listed Pallinghurst has now garnered acceptances for 75.18% of shares in takeover target, Aim-listed miner Gemfields. Pallinghurst CEO Arne Frandsen noted that the company was &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; to have received more than 75% support from Gemfields&rsquo; shareholders, including the majority of Gemfields&rsquo; minority shareholders. Ninety-six per cent of Pallinghurst&rsquo;s shareholders on Monday voted in favour of the transaction. &ldquo;It is clear that the proposed transaction has the broadest support from both sets of shareholders. &ldquo;In addition, the Fosun offer backed by Gemfields management, has lapsed. Hence, once we&rsquo;ve had the first closing on July 4, we will move to delist Gemfields,&rdquo; said Frandsen.
