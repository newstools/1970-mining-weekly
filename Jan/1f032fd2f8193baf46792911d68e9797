JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; UK energy developer Oracle Coalfields is a step closer to finalising the necessary approvals for a mine-mouth power plant in Pakistan with a date now having been set for public hearings to consider the project&rsquo;s environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA). Oracle reported on Wednesday that it expected the final approval of the ESIA &ldquo;shortly after&rdquo; the public hearing, which would be held on July 13. The company is developing a combined lignite mineral resource and mine-mouth power plant in the Thar Desert in the southeast of Sindh province. Oracle believes that a power shortage in that country makes the development of Thar a compelling development. The company&rsquo;s subsidiary, TEPL, has registered the 660 MW mine-mouth power plant with the Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB), a division of the Ministry of Water and Power, which approves independent power producer&#39;s proposals to build, own and operate power plants in Pakistan. This registration proposes an overall project of 1 320 MW to be constructed in two phases. In order to obtain the full approval for the project from PPIB a generation licence and electricity tariff also need to be agreed with the authorities along with an approved ESIA for the proposed power plant.
