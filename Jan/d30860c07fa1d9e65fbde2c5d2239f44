LIMA &ndash; Southern Copper on Wednesday reported net income of $314.4-million for the first quarter, up 70% from $185.1-million a year earlier and 82% above the $172-million posted in the fourth quarter of 2016. Southern Copper, owned by Grupo Mexico, is one of the world&#39;s largest copper producers and operates mines in Mexico and Peru. The increase in profit came as copper prices rose 25% and zinc prices rose 65.8%, the company said. A two-week strike last month at its Toquepala and Cuajone copper mines as well as its Ilo refinery in Peru reduced copper production by 1 418 t, Southern Copper said in its earnings report. The two mines together produced 310 000 t of copper last year, according to government data. Net sales grew 27.2% to $1.6-billion, while the cost of sales grew 16.1% to $843.8-million, Southern Copper said. The company&#39;s capital investments grew 10% to $245.6-million due to a plan to boost copper output at Toquepala by 100 000 t to 260 000 t by 2019. With the expansion, Southern Copper will produce one-million tonnes in 2019, compared with 900 000 t produced last year, chairperson German Larrea said.
