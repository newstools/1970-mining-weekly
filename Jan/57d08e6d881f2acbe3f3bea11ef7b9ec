JOHANNESBURG &ndash; The Democratic Alliance (DA) said on Friday that it was not impressed with the appointment of Advocate Thabo Mokoena as director-general of the Department of Mineral Resources, because he has no experience in mining or commerce. DA spokesperson on mineral resources, James Lorimer, said Minerals Minister Mosebenzi Zwane was continuing the estrangement of his department from the mining industry by making the appointment without consultation. &ldquo;But this is not the biggest problem. In appointing Mokoena, he has appointed somebody with no visible mining experience and no experience of commerce of any kind,&rdquo; Lorimer said. Mokoena&rsquo;s appointment on Thursday to replace acting director-general, David Msiza, was endorsed by Cabinet this week. Mokoena, a former secretary of the Free State legislature, holds a law degree from the University of the Western Cape and a postgraduate diploma in law. &ldquo;Mokoena comes from the position of head of the administration of the Free State legislature. He has a reputation as a mild-mannered man who will not make waves,&rdquo; said Lorimer. &ldquo;There are indications his redeployment has something to do with making his former position available to a favourite of the province&rsquo;s ruling clique.&rdquo; The DA was echoing the sentiments of the Chamber of Mines, which expressed concern and surprise at Mokoena&rsquo;s appointment. In a statement on Thursday, the Chamber said it was not consulted before the appointment was made. &ldquo;The mining industry has a twin challenge of attracting investments and growing the industry; and is also dealing with challenges of transformation and inclusive growth,&rdquo; the Chamber said. &ldquo;The industry regards leadership capabilities as being very important to deal with such imperatives which are immediate for the industry and the country.&rdquo;
