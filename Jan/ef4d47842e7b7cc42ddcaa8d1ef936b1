HAMBURG &ndash; Aurubis, Europe&#39;s biggest copper smelter, plans a new corporate strategy involving expansion into production of other nonferrous metals alongside its traditional copper business, new CEO Juergen Schachler said on Thursday. He did not name possible non-ferrous metals for expansion, but told the group&#39;s annual shareholders&#39; meeting that Aurubis should become a &quot;multimetals producer.&quot; He also said the group&#39;s new corporate strategy, called Vision 2025, could involve acquisitions of suitable metal production companies. But an expansion into mining will not be a part of the strategy, said Schachler, who took over in July 2016. Aurubis&#39; last acquisition was in 2011 when it took over the rolled copper operations of the Luvata group.
