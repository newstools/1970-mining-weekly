JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; US aluminium producer Alcoa is off to a strong start as an independent company, with the firm on Monday reporting first-quarter revenue and profit growth on stronger alumina and aluminium prices. Alcoa posted net income of $225-million, or $1.21 a share, in the first quarter of 2017, compared with a net loss of $125-million, or $0.68 a share, in fourth quarter 2016, which included costs to streamline the portfolio. Excluding the impact of special items, first quarter adjusted net income was $117-million, or $0.63 a share. In the fourth quarter of 2016, adjusted net income was $26-million, or $0.14 a share, excluding special items.&nbsp; Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), excluding special items, increased by 59% quarter-on-quarter to $533-million. Revenue rose by 5% quarter-on-quarter to $2.7-billion, reflecting higher alumina and aluminium prices. &ldquo;Alcoa is off to a strong start with our first full quarter as an independent company,&rdquo; Alcoa CEO Roy Harvey said in a statement. The group recently streamlined its businesses into three segments focused on bauxite, alumina and aluminium. &ldquo;In our bauxite segment, our third-party business remained strong and we continued to grow profits, while our alumina and aluminium segments captured the benefits of improved market pricing to increase earnings substantially,&rdquo; Harvey said. Alcoa separated from its aerospace and automotive businesses in 2016 and started trading as a standalone company on November 1. Up to Monday&rsquo;s close, Alcoa had risen 43% since the split. Alcoa kept its full-year 2017 adjusted Ebitda, excluding special items, guidance unchanged at between $2.1-billion and $2.3-billion, based on April 2017 market assumptions, and net performance of $50-million for the year. The company is projecting 2017 global aluminium demand growth of 4.5% to 5% and expects a modest global aluminium surplus of 300 000 to 700 000 metric tons. Alcoa&rsquo;s former downstream business is trading as Arconic. The industrial company is currently in a proxy fight with Elliott Management, which in January nominated five directors to serve on the Arconic board. Last week, Klaus Kleinfeld resigned as CEO of Arconic, after having sent a letter to a senior Elliott officer without the consultation of the board.
