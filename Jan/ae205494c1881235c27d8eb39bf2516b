SANTIAGO &ndash; Access to the large Chuquicamata copper mine in Chile was blocked Wednesday by workers from one of its unions, in what the union said was a &quot;warning&quot; over company plans to alter the mine&#39;s occupational structure. Mine owner Codelco said that output had been unaffected so far as workers from previous shifts were continuing to keep operations going.
