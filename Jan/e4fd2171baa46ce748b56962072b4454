PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold developer Dacian Gold has signed its first gold hedging contract over its Mount Morgans project, in Western Australia. The company on Wednesday told shareholders that it had forward-sold 52 000 oz of gold at an average price of A$1 782/oz. The gold will be delivered between July 2019 and June 2020, with the hedge representing some 26% of the forecast gold production from the Mt Morgans operation. &ldquo;With first production now just nine months away, we believe it was prudent to capitalise on the historically high Australian dollar gold price to underpin forecast project revenues at a time of waste-stripping part of the Jupiter openpit,&rdquo; said Dacian executive chairperson Rohan Williams. He noted that the forward sales contract provided some security, and did so at a price which was nearly A$200/oz more than the assumed price in the Mt Morgans feasibility study. The A$220-million project is expected to deliver 186 000 oz of gold over the first four years of an eight-year mine life, based on a 2.5-million-tonne-a-year carbon-in-leach operation.
