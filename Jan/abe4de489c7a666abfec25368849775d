LIMA &ndash; Workers at a zinc smelter in Peru operated by a unit of Brazil&#39;s Votorantim Participacoes called off a strike planned for next week after the company agreed to settle most of their demands, a union leader said on Friday. The 350-member union earlier this week had announced the planned work stoppage at the Cajamarquilla plant over demands for better pay and working conditions. It was set to begin on May 6 and would have been the union&#39;s first strike in 16 years. &quot;The company called us for a dialogue and agreed to solve most of our claims, therefore the strike is suspended,&quot; union leader Daniel Trejo told Reuters by telephone. A representative of Votorantim Metais confirmed the suspension of the strike by email. The plant, located 20 km east of Lima, last year refined some 340 000 t of zinc. Votorantim Metais also operates the Peruvian copper and zinc producer Milpo which operates the Cerro Lindo mine, located south of Lima.
