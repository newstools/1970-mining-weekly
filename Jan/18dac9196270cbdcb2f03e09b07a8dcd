PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed coal miner Wollongong Coal is in discussions with the administrators of mining services provider Delta SBD to reinstate workers to allow for the restart of the Wongawilli colliery, in New South Wales. Operations at Wongawilli temporarily ceased on May 31 after Delta SBD went into administration. The administrators stood down the contract workforce at Wongawilli, resulting in the mine&rsquo;s shutdown. Wollongong said on Friday that the company was in discussions with the administrators with a view to putting in place arrangements to reinstate the contract workforce necessary to restart the colliery, either in whole, or in part, during the administration period.
