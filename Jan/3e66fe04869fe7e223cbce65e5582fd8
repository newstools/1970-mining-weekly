LONDON &ndash; Gold hit four-week lows on Monday as the dollar held firm and the market waited for comments from a top Federal Reserve official on US monetary policy, but prices were supported by the start of talks on the terms of Britain&#39;s departure from the European Union. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1 251 an ounce by 08:52 GMT, up from an earlier $1 248.63, its lowest since May 24. US gold futures fell 0.3% to $1 252.5. New York Fed President William Dudley is due to take part in a roundtable with local business leaders later on Monday. Dudley&#39;s comments, if hawkish, could reinforce the dollar&#39;s uptrend, which when it rises makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially weakening demand. &quot;The dollar is a large part of what&#39;s going on with gold,&quot; said ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson. &quot;I do see some support from uncertainty about the UK government and the start of Brexit negotiations.&quot; British Prime Minister Theresa May failing to win a parliamentary election earlier this month has, alongside Brexit negotiations starting on Monday in Brussels, fuelled political uncertainty. Weighing on gold is a drop in holdings of physically-backed exchange traded funds to 55.231-million ounces from 55.654-million ounces last Wednesday, when the Fed raised rates and pushed the dollar index to two-week highs. On the technical front, support for gold kicks in at $1 248, near the 100-day moving average, and resistance sits at $1 260, near the 55-day moving average, traders said. &quot;There&#39;s very strong support at the 200-day moving average, just below $1 240,&quot; one trader said. Elsewhere, palladium was up 1.5% at $873.65 an ounce. Earlier this month the metal used to make autocatalysts for gasoline-fuelled cars hit a 16-year high at $914.70 an ounce as the market fretted about shortages in the near term. But analysts say palladium&#39;s gains of more than 25% so far this year may not be justified given slowing auto sales. &quot;There are some concerning signals from the two largest gasoline (palladium) auto markets, the US and China,&quot; ICBC Standard Bank analysts said in a note. &quot;The pace of sales growth in both countries has slowed sharply this year. There are a several reasons why, namely credit, a maturing business cycle, and reduced incentives.&quot; US passenger car sales fell 9.8% in May from a year earlier. In China the drop was 0.1%, but expectations are for further falls over coming months. Silver gained 0.3% to $16.63 an ounce and platinum slid 0.2% to $922.50 an ounce.
