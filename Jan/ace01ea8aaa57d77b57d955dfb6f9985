SYDNEY - Any significant changes to the corporate structure of Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton would need to be consistent with a &quot;national interest&quot; test under the law, the Australian government said on Tuesday. Activist shareholder Elliott Advisors on Monday proposed BHP Billiton scrap its dual-company structure in favour of a primary listing in London and a secondary listing in Sydney. &quot;A change in the corporate structure and listing arrangement would need to be carefully considered against the provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act,&quot; a spokeswoman for Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said on Tuesday. &quot;If the changes were significant they would need to be consistent with Australia&rsquo;s national interest test under that Act.&quot; The Australian government in 2001 approved the merger of Melbourne-based BHP and London-based Billiton based on a number of conditions designed to ensure the miner kept close ties to Australia. BHP Billiton on Monday said the Elliott proposal, which involves replacing the dual-listed company with a single company domiciled in Britain, would require the approval of Australia&#39;s Foreign Investment Review Board. In presentation slides, Elliott said the changes in the listing structure would add $1.50 of value per BHP Billiton share for the holders of London-listed shares but take away $1 in value from the holders of the Australian-listed shares. The bulk of Elliott&#39;s BHP Billiton shareholding is in the UK-listed arm, in which it holds a stake of 4.1%. It has rights to acquire an interest of up to 0.4% in the Australian-listed arm. Elliott also proposed that BHP Billiton split off its US oil and gas division, a move the company has rejected previously.
