MELBOURNE &ndash; China&rsquo;s multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative can deliver a major boost for commodities and will add about 150-million tons to global steel demand, according to BHP Billiton, the world&rsquo;s largest miner. The plan to develop infrastructure and rebuild ancient trading routes from China to Europe overland and by sea has seen projects initiated worth about $1.3-trillion, according to Melbourne-based BHP, the biggest exporter of coking coal and the third-largest iron ore supplier. Investments worth $313-billion to $502-billion could be funneled to 62 Belt-Road countries over the next five years, Credit Suisse Group AG said last month. &ldquo;Everywhere where we see the infrastructure being built, on the back of that there will be economic development that will trigger copper demand, which will trigger energy demand,&rdquo; BHP&rsquo;s COO Arnoud Balhuizen told reporters Thursday in Melbourne. &ldquo;Steel produced in China will be used along the road, and that of course is good for demand for our commodities.&rdquo; BHP on Thursday lifted force majeure restrictions at Chile&rsquo;s Escondida copper mine, where workers carried out a 44-day strike earlier this year, Balhuizen told reporters. Coking coal sales continue to be subject to restrictions following a cyclone in Australia in March, he said. The producer declined 0.7% to A$23.73 on Thursday in Sydney, extending its decline this year to 5.3%. The &ldquo;One Belt One Road&rdquo; initiative promises &ldquo;huge demand for resources, services and technology,&rdquo; and is &ldquo;an opportunity like no other,&rdquo; Balhuizen said earlier in a speech. BHP gets about 43% of full-year revenue from China and a total of at least 68% from Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China&rsquo;s plan, lauded by President Xi Jinping as a &quot;project of the century,&quot; has the potential to generate about 120-million tons of crude steel demand, according to Citigroup. Increased appetite from infrastructure will support steel even as there&rsquo;s a slowdown in China&rsquo;s housing sector, Templeton Emerging Markets Group Executive Chairman Mark Mobius said last month in an interview. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s plans for rural electrification, which aim to supply power to every citizen by 2019, and the drive to provide more affordable housing, will also boost commodities and are likely to &ldquo;have a material impact on demand for coal, iron ore, copper and petroleum,&rdquo; Balhuizen said in his speech. BHP sees global demand for potash growing at 2% to 3% a year through 2030, as the world&rsquo;s population rises and crop demand swells by 50% by 2050, he said. BHP may seek board approval for its Jansen potash project in Canada as early as next June, the producer said last month.
