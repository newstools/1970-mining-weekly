VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; New analysis by the US Geological Survey shows domestic gold production for March rising 9.2% over February, and by 7.4% over March 2016, to 19 700 kg, the organisation said in its latest &lsquo;Mineral Industry Survey&rsquo; published on Tuesday. Based on unrounded data, the average daily gold production for US mines was 635 kg in March, about 643 kg in February, almost 609 in January, and about 608 kg for the full year of 2016. This points to growing output from US producers, in step with mainly positive price movements for the yellow metal during the first quarter of 2017, following a sharp price correction in the aftermath of the US elections. The lion&rsquo;s share of production is from Nevada, followed by Alaska and other US states. First-quarter US gold production was off to a strong start, outpacing comparable monthly output in 2016 by a significant margin. Total 2016 US gold output came to 222 000 kg, with Nevada accounting for about 165 000 kg, Alaska for 27 600 kg and other states for 30 000 kg of gold.
