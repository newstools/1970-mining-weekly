PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed TNG has inked a project facilitation agreement (PFA) with the Northern Territory government over the proposed location for its Tivan metals refinery, which will form part of its Mount Peake vanadium-titanium-iron project. The PFA is a key agreement that will ensure a &ldquo;whole-of-government&rdquo; approach is adopted in developing the project, including facilitating the necessary environmental and planning approvals, and provision of land and port access. TNG on Thursday said the company is undertaking a range of technical, engineering and environmental studies to fully assess the proposed Darwin site prior to making a final investment decision. The proposed Tivan refinery will produce high-purity products from the Mount Peake vanadium-titanium-iron deposit, located some 235 km north-west of Alice Springs. The company expects the refinery to produce around 17 560 t/y of vanadium pentoxide, 236 000 t/y of titanium dioxide and 637 000 t/y of iron for export. TNG MD Paul Burton told shareholders that the signing of the PFA marked another exciting milestone for the Mount Peake project. &ldquo;The project has already been awarded Major Project status in the Northern Territory, and this agreement is a further indication of the proactive and positive approach which the Northern Territory government is adopting to help facilitate the development of this major new Australian resource project.&rdquo; Burton said the Tivan refinery was a key component to the overall project production and logistics chain, which would see the application of state-of-the-art processing technology to cost-effectively extract high-value vanadium, titanium and iron from the Mount Peake deposit and produce high-purity metals for export. Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said some 1 700 construction jobs and a further 600 ongoing jobs could be created with the signing of the PFA. &ldquo;This is an A$850-million project with the potential for 500 jobs during construction and more than 200 jobs during operation of the mine, plus more than 1 200 jobs during construction and 400 jobs during operation of the refinery,&rdquo; Gunner said.
