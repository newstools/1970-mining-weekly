JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-quoted exploration company Tethyan Resources has signed an access agreement with the municipality of Raska for the use of public roads to move its drilling rigs and equipment to the Suva Ruda project, in southern Serbia. The agreement allows Tethyan and its contractors with access permission for vehicle weights exceeding normal limits and regulates the manner in which road damage will be compensated for by the company. This will allow Tethyan to progress its 2017 field programme. Mapping and soil sampling programmes have started at additional exploration targets within the Suva Ruda permit. The drilling programme is progressing smoothly and Tethyan CEO Peter Mullens says the current programme will be completed by the end of the month. The company is exploring for copper and gold within the Tethyan mineral belt. Currently, Tethyan holds several licences in Serbia and is looking for other copper and gold projects in Eastern Europe, specifically Serbia and Bulgaria.
