JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-V-listed Galane Gold has entered into a letter of intent (LoI) with South African-focused Vantage Goldfields to acquire all of its outstanding shares. Vantage is an Australian company with mining assets in South Africa&rsquo;s Barberton Greenstone Belt. &quot;This represents another significant step towards Galane&#39;s stated goal to reshape into a long-life and low-cost operation that can produce positive returns for investors across commodity cycles,&rdquo; CEO Nick Brodie said in a statement. The Vantage mines are located within 30 km of Galane&rsquo;s existing operations at Galaxy Gold. &ldquo;We hope to leverage synergies [between the mines] to create an operating asset in the Barberton area which, together with the our Galaxy property, is expected to result in a combined resource exceeding 5.8-million ounces,&rdquo; he added. This would stem from production of over 160 000 oz/y and an all-in sustaining cost of less than $900/oz. Operations at Vantage&#39;s Barbrook and Lily mines were suspended in 2016 owing to financial difficulties and were placed in business rescue. Unstable ground at the Lily mine resulted in the mine&rsquo;s closure. A container, with three employees inside, has yet to be recovered following a February 2016 crown pillar collapse at the mine.
