VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Non-profit organisation Geoscience BC has announced a third phase in a series of aerial surveys, with the aim to identify hidden mineral potential in north central and north-eastern British Columbia. Called Search Phase III, the survey will use helicopters fitted with magnetic sensors to build a better understanding of geology in the area. Once complete, project information will be made publicly available to help communities, First Nations, the resource sector and government to make informed decisions about responsible development and investment in the province. This includes helping explorers to decide where to focus their mining efforts, which will eventually lead to on-the-ground exploration activities, job creation and stimulate regional economic activity. Search Phase III covers about 9 600 km2 &ndash; an area approximately the same size as the Haida Gwaii islands, offshore British Columbia. Final details are yet to be confirmed, but it is proposed to cover a remote area that includes AuRico Metals&rsquo; Kemess Underground mine project, which recently received an environmental assessment certificate, the organisation said in a statement last week. The project is funded in part by Northern Development Initiative Trust&rsquo;s economic development infrastructure programme with a C$125 000 grant. Geoscience BC was established in 2005 through an initial C$25-million investment by the provincial government. Since then, the province has provided it with C$71.7-million in funding to help further mineral and energy geoscience initiatives. Geoscience BC has also secured more than C$23-million in additional funding from the resource sector, academia and other government sources. British Columbia is the only province in Canada that uses an organisation such as Geoscience BC to assist in the delivery of public geoscience.
