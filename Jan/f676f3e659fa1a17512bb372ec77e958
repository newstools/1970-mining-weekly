JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Russian diamond miner Alrosa have agreed to enhance diamond trade cooperation. The parties discussed options for expanding Alrosa&rsquo;s trading activities at the Dubai Diamond Exchange &ndash; a DMCC entity &ndash; as well as agreements on enhanced efforts to stem the flow of undeclared synthetic diamonds entering the marketplace. &ldquo;With a relationship that spans 15 years, DMCC is delighted to strengthen its collaboration with Alrosa. As the fastest-growing Free Zone and the third-largest diamond trading centre in the world, Alrosa leverages DMCC and Dubai as a trading hub,&rdquo; said DMCC chairperson Ahmed Bin Sulayem. Alrosa&rsquo;s recently appointed president Sergey Ivanov added that Dubai was one of the world&#39;s leading diamond trading centers. In 2016, Alrosa sold rough diamonds worth $259.5-million to companies in the United Arab Emirates. Alrosa&#39;s affiliate Arcos East DMCC has also been successfully operating at the Dubai Diamond Exchange.
