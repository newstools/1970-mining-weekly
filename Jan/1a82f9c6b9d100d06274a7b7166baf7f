PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Uranium miner Paladin Energy has abandoned a sales agreement with ASX-listed Avira Energy over a 30% interest in the Manyingee project, in Western Australia. The two companies in July last year signed a binding term sheet under which Avira would acquire an initial 30% interest in the project for $10-million, and a subsequent 45% interest for a further $20-million. Paladin on Monday said that While Avira had been able to satisfy a number of the conditions of the sale, including a positive shareholder vote and approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board, the company did not close the required capital raising within the pre-agreed timeframe to allow for the transaction to complete. Avira told shareholders that the current environment for new uranium mines in Western Australia was challenging and, as a result, investors who were previously committed to supporting the company&rsquo;s capital raise have now withdrawn. The two companies remain in discussions regarding the Manyingee project, with Avira telling shareholders that it will continue to seek other &ldquo;worthwhile&rdquo; uranium and resource projects that potential investors will find compelling.
