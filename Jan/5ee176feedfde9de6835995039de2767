LONDON &ndash; Shareholders DE Shaw, M&amp;G and Sothic said in a statement on Wednesday London-listed gold miner Petropavlovsk&#39;s board needs an overhaul, but they have no intention of taking control of the company. Shareholders, including M&amp;G and Sothic, have put forward resolutions ahead of the company&#39;s annual general meeting next week aimed at replacing chairperson Peter Hambro, who set up the Russian-focused miner in 1994. Three shareholder advisors - PIRC, Glass Lewis and ISS have all said they recommend opposing the changes. But in a statement seen by Reuters, DE Shaw, M&amp;G and Sothic said change was overdue. &quot;Petropavlovsk needs a board with strong, independent directors who can support and constructively challenge management on operational, financial and strategic issues in order to return value to shareholders,&quot; it said. The three said they had no intention of taking control of Petropavlosk and were not acting under the influence of Russian conglomerate Renova, which has also demanded change.
