PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan has revived the possibility of scrapping a 25c/t levy on iron-ore produced from the state, in exchange for up-front payments. The Premier over the weekend admitted that the state government was weighing the option of a &lsquo;buy-out&rsquo; of the lease rental fee in an effort to combat the budget issues facing Western Australia. The current rental fee is estimated to contribute some A$125-million a year to state coffers, from majors BHP and Rio Tinto. &ldquo;Obviously, we have a very major budget issue in Western Australia and it is quite catastrophic the financial situation that we have been left,&rdquo; McGowan was quoted by the Australian Financial Review. &ldquo;We are looking at many options as to how to address that.&rdquo; However, the Premier noted that the &lsquo;buy-out&rsquo; would only be considered if the companies involved agreed on the proposal, and if it were in the interest of taxpayers. &ldquo;But, you don&#39;t do these things unless you are going to make a lot of money and the taxpayers are well rewarded for it.&quot; BHP on Monday told Mining Weekly Online that the company was not in talks with the Western Australian government regarding the buy-out, with a spokesperson pointing out that the company had paid some A$11-billion in royalties to the Western Australian government in the past decade. The Association of Mining &amp; Exploration Companies (AMEC), meanwhile, said that, if implemented, the buy-out would limit future investment in Western Australia, and would not benefit taxpayers. &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s concept is increasing Western Australia&rsquo;s sovereign risk,&rdquo; AMEC CEO Simon Bennison said. &ldquo;As was established during the debate around the National Party&rsquo;s ill-conceived $5 tax - every dollar raised through this &lsquo;cashing out&rsquo; will head east via the Commonwealth Grant&rsquo;s Commission&rsquo;s redistribution.&rdquo; &ldquo;It creates a strong incentive for mining companies to curtail their investment in Western Australia to less than 15 years. This is not a good policy decision, and is unlikely to raise the revenue that the government hopes it will.&rdquo; McGowan&rsquo;s plans echoes those tabled by former Premier Colin Barnett last year, which saw the Western Australian government approach both Rio Tinto and BHP with a proposal to pay out their lease rental in a lump sum. Both iron-ore producers declined the offer, with Rio Tinto saying at the time that it was already making a significant contribution to the Western Australian economy, having paid A$13-billion in royalties since 2006.
