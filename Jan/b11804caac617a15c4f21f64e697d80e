JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Vertically integrated specialty alloys producer Afarak Mogale is temporarily shutting down its P1 furnace at the Mogale Alloys processing plant for unscheduled maintenance. The dual-listed company said on Thursday that the furnace would not be operational between July 24 and the end of August; the P2 and P3 furnaces at the site will also be shut down for a week for scheduled maintenance. The shutdown is expected to result in around 5 500 t of charge chrome not being produced. Afarak is still assessing the extent of the impact on its third-quarter financial performance. It has also, therefore, initiated talks with insurers.
