JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed coal miner Ncondezi Energy has raised an additional $582 000 from existing lenders and senior management to fund the search for a new partner and to provide working capital for the group. The miner, which is developing the Ncondezi coal mine, in Mozambique&rsquo;s Tete province, is seeking a new joint venture development partner for the coal-to-power project after it suspended exclusive discussions with Shanghai Electric Power (SEP) in May. The suspension followed more than three years of negotiations and work alongside SEP and, notwithstanding SEP&rsquo;s assurances that it was committed to the project, it did not provide the much-needed funding for the project. The search for a new partner formally started in early June, with Ncondezi encouraged by the &ldquo;quality of the participants&rdquo; to date, which represent a broad set of well-known international names as well as proven regional players. While the initial results are encouraging, there can be no certainty that the process will be successful. &ldquo;The process remains on track [for us] to provide an update to shareholders in July,&rdquo; the company noted.
