PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Coal developer Paringa Resources has completed a bookbuild to raise A$53-million to complete the financing of its Poplar Grove mine, in Western Kentucky&rsquo;s Illinois basin. The company on Tuesday told shareholders that it had received commitments for the placement of 102-million shares, at an issue price of 52c each, to institutional and sophisticated investors. The placement will be completed in two tranches, with the first 44.6-million shares to be issued under the company&rsquo;s placement capacity. The issue of the remaining 57.3-million shares will be subject to shareholder approval. The share placement is in addition to the recent five-year $20-million debt facility secured from Macquarie Bank to assist in funding the Poplar Grove mine. &ldquo;This successful capital raising completes the funding required for the development of the Poplar Grove coal mine, starting in July 2017. We now have&nbsp; a strong financial position to deliver on our plan to become a 6.6-million-tonne-a-year Illinois basin producer, starting with construction of the low cost and high margin Poplar Grove mine, and then followed by the fully permitted, high margin Cypress mine,&rdquo; said Paringa MD and CEO Todd Hannigan. A recently expanded bankable feasibility study into the Poplar Grove mine estimated that for a capital investment of $44.7-million, the Poplar Grove mine could be developed into a 2.8-million-tonne-a-year operation, with all-in operating capital estimated at $29.24/t. The project is expected to have a mine life of 25 years and will deliver average yearly earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and amortisation of $67-million.
