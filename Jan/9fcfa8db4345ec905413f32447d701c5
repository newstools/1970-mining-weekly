JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed miner Premier African Minerals has declared a maiden inferred resource at its wholly-owned Zulu lithium and tantalum project in Zimbabwe, with an estimated resource of 20.1-million tonnes grading 1.06% lithium oxide (Li2O) and 51 parts per million tantalum pentoxide, using a cutoff grade of 0.5% Li2O. The resource, which is compliant with the South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, or Samrec, is further estimated to contain 562 000 t of lithium carbonate equivalant (LTE) and 1 025 t of tantalum pentoxide. The estimate covers only 35% of Zulu&#39;s known 3.5 km surface strike length and drilling continues to upgrade and expand it. CEO George Roach says the estimate reinforces Premier&rsquo;s belief that Zulu is a significant new lithium deposit with all the hallmarks of a world-class lithium project. The resource estimate was based on Premier&rsquo;s initial 2 511 m exploration drilling programme, which was focused on only 1 200 m of the southern part of the known 3.5 km strike length of the project. The drilling programme confirms that the deposit remains open at depth and on strike. &quot;We started an extended drilling programme focussed on infill drilling in the southern part of the deposit, as well as step out drilling of various areas along the 3.5 km known strike length, which we believe to host further substantial lithium mineralisation. &ldquo;To date, the results have been very good and we are looking forward to delivering further additions to our resource inventory in the coming months and laying the foundations for a substantial, long-life strategic metal business,&rdquo; Roach highlighted.
