RIO DE JANEIRO &ndash; Brazilian miner Vale is expected to cut the number of executive directors to four from six, according to a local newspaper column published on Thursday. The piece by columnist Ancelmo Gois of the El Globo newspaper did not offer further detail on the restructuring plans. Vale did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman, who took charge last month, set up working groups to measure risks and returns of each of Vale&#39;s business units, according to a Credit Suisse report. Vale, the world&#39;s largest iron-ore miner, also hired Brazilian consultancy firm Falconi to advise on cost-cutting efforts.
