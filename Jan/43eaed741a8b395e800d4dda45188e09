PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The TSX has given uranium miner Paladin Energy 90 days to comply with all the requirements for continued listing, including its financial solvency. If the company could not demonstrate that it met the bourse&#39;s requirements before August 14, the company&rsquo;s securities will be delisted 30 days later. Paladin told shareholders on Friday that the company would work with the TSX to demonstrate that it satisfied the requirements for continued listing, but warned that there was no assurance that it would be able to achieve compliance with the continued listing requirements, within the required time frame. The company meanwhile also held a meeting with the holders of its $274-million convertible bonds, due in April this year, with the bond holders agreeing to defer the final maturity date and interest payment due until the end of September this year.
