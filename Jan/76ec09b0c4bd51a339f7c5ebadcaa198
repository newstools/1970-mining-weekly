PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Niuminco has moved to take full ownership of the Eddie Creek gold/silver mining lease, in Papua New Guinea. The company currently holds an 83% interest in the project, and has struck a deal with former joint venture partner Mincor Resources to acquire the remaining 17% interest for A$150 000. The purchase consideration will be payable two years from the completion date of the transaction, in either cash or shares, or earlier should Niuminco sell the leases to a third party. &ldquo;We are pleased to take 100% control of the Eddie Creek mine as we now move towards greater processing capacity on completion of the current plant upgrade,&rdquo; said Niuminco MD Tracey Lake. Niuminco is currently working to increase production up from the pilot mining and production operation, which was started in early 2014, targeting a mining and processing throughput rate of between 40 t/d and 60 t/d. Niuminco recently revealed plans to spin-off its 72.1%-held TNT Mines, which holds tin and tungsten assets in Tasmania, through an initial public offering (IPO) on the ASX. Some 27.5-million shares would be issued at 20c each, with the aim of raising A$5.5-million. The funds would be used to advance exploration and development of TNT&rsquo;s Tasmanian deposits, to repay some A$956 000 in loans owed to Niuminco, and to provide the company with working capital and with funds to evaluate new investment opportunities. After a successful IPO, TNT will have an implied market capitalisation of A$6-million with about A$4-million in cash after the costs of the issue and after repaying all outstanding debt.
