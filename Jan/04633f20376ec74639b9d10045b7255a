JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Dual-listed coal developer Kibo Mining on Wednesday said recent discussions with key stakeholders of its Mbeya coal-to-power project (MCPP), in Tanzania, have resulted in &ldquo;significant progress&rdquo; for the further development of the project. A recent request for an expedited development of the MCPP was followed by a series of meetings, held on June 12 and 13, where a clear agenda and associated schedule has been agreed with relevant government stakeholders to work on specific development aspects of the MCPP that are dependent on negotiating, agreeing and concluding agreements and approvals with the Tanzanian government. Further, the company noted that the environmental- and social-impact assessment submissions for the coal mine and power station had been duly processed for certification, pending a final review and verification of recommendations, with the final review in an advanced stage of completion. The special mining licence (SML) application for the Mbeya coal mine has also been processed in its entirety and is now awaiting final approval, pending environmental certification, while engagement with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals on the latest developments in relation to possible further changes in mining policies and the Mining Act has reconfirmed that the company&#39;s operations are not affected by the current debate around it. CEO Louis Coetzee noted that, over the last two weeks, the company has seen strong and committed engagement from all stakeholders. &ldquo;From these meetings, we have also developed a far better appreciation of the reasons for the perceived slow processing of the SML application and environmental certification. &ldquo;It is evident that the relevant departments concerned with the processing of these applications have taken a very diligent and proactive approach given the integrated nature of the MCPP, which avoided unnecessary and lengthy delays but also brought about significant cost savings for the company,&rdquo; he highlighted.
