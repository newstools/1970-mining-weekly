PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Yancoal Australia has made a tag-along offer to acquire Mitsubishi Development&rsquo;s 32.4% interest in the Hunter Valley operations for $710-million. The tag-along offer fulfilled Yancoal&rsquo;s obligation to Mitsubishi under the sale and purchase agreement for Yancoal&rsquo;s $2.45-billion buy of Coal &amp; Allied, announced in January this year. Coal &amp; Allied is the holding company for mining major Rio Tinto&rsquo;s thermal coal business in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. It holds a 67.6% stake in the Hunter Valley Operations mine, with Mitsubishi holding the remaining interest. Coal &amp; Allied also holds an 80% stake in the Mount Thorley mine and a 55.6% stake in the Warkworth mine, as well as a 36.5% interest in Port Waratah Coal Services, which owns a coal export terminal at the Port of Newcastle. &ldquo;The binding offer is another important milestone in the strategic acquisition of Coal &amp; Allied and sends a clear message to all stakeholders of Yancoal Australia&rsquo;s continued investment into the local resources sector,&rdquo; said Yancoal CEO Reinhold Schmidt. &ldquo;We have negotiated a commercially robust offer in the best interest of all parties and the future growth of Coal &amp; Allied assets.&rdquo; Schmidt said that with Rio&rsquo;s support, Yancoal was looking forward to progressing the next steps in the Coal &amp; Allied transaction to become Australia&rsquo;s largest independent coal producer. The Mitsubishi transaction was conditional upon the completion of the Coal &amp; Allied transaction, as well as the receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. Last month, the Foreign Investment Review Board approved Yancoal&rsquo;s acquisition of Coal &amp; Allied.
