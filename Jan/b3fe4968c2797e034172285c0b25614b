VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold explorer Probe Metals has signed a definitive agreement with QMX Gold to buy a 100% interest in the Aurbel East property, located next to its Val-d&#39;Or East project, near Val-d&#39;Or, Quebec. According to a Probe statement on Thursday, the Aurbel asset is also strategically located west of the company&rsquo;s Resenor gold deposit and Richmont Mines&#39; producing Beaufor mine. Aurbel East comprises 22 mining claims and increases Probe&#39;s landholdings in Val-d&#39;Or to 316 km2, making it one of the largest consolidated land packages in the Val-d&#39;Or mining camp. The property will be bought for C$1-million in cash, subject to regulatory approval and closing. Probe also announced that it has acquired a 100% interest in six mining claims in and next to the Val-d&#39;Or East project from private landowners, for a cash payment of C$25 000. Meanwhile, work continues on the company&#39;s 75 000-m drill programme at Val-d&#39;Or East, with four rigs currently testing resource expansion potential, including follow-up drilling on three new discovery areas. Based on work done by EI Coco Explorations, in 1978, the Resenor deposit has a historical, noncompliant resource estimate of 181 000 t grading 8.6 g/t gold in the inferred category. The company reported that as of Thursday, and before the acquisition of Aurbel East, the company has about C$35-million in cash and marketable securities.
