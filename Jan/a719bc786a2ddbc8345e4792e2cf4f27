JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; West Africa-focused diamond and gold exploration company Golden Saint has recovered 14 diamonds, weighing a total of 10.46 ct, from its Tongo licence, in Sierra Leone. The diamonds range from 0.25 ct to 2.15 ct apiece, while some 23.62 g of alluvial gold was also recovered from the gravels treated. At Golden Saint&rsquo;s Baja licence area, also in Sierra Leone, operations were focused on relocating the stockpile of gravels at Baja Site 4 to a higher and more secure location. &ldquo;This will reduce the risk of loss associated with the rising water table resulting from the impending wet season,&rdquo; the company said. Bulk sampling operations have also resumed and are operating concurrently with the gravel relocation exercise. BOARD CHANGES Golden Saint has made several board changes, appointing Yohannes Prawiro business development executive director, effective from July 24. The board also proposed the appointment of mining engineer Pierre Fourie as Golden Saint CEO. Fourie is a member of Rock Forage Consulting Services, which is currently engaged as the company&#39;s technical consultant. Meanwhile, the miner has also appointed Hassan Kargbo as its exploration manager. His key responsibilities will include the preparation of geological strategies and planning policies, as well as the supervision and coordination of all other geological work. Meanwhile, Golden Saint FD Keng Hock Seah has resigned and will leave the company end-July.
