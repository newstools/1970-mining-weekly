VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The US Environmental Protection Agency has approved Texas-based miner Uranium Energy Corp&#39;s (UEC&#39;s) exemption request for a 2 180 ha acquifer for the Burke Hollow in-situ recovery (ISR) project, in South Texas.&nbsp; Burke Hollow is the third project to be developed as part of the company&#39;s hub-and-spoke strategy that is designed for low-cost ISR production to be processed at the nearby Hobson plant. The project&#39;s 4 450 ha mine area permit was approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) in December. Two other disposal well permits were also issued in July 2015, to make up three of the four major permits required for the project. The last major approval is the radioactive material licence, which remains under technical review with the TCEQ. The company&#39;s 2017 drilling campaign at Burke Hollow started earlier this week, with two contracted drill rigs and plans to drill up to 100 delineation and exploration holes.&nbsp; The primary objective of this campaign is to complete the exploration and delineation drilling phase of two closely-related Goliad Lower B trends that will constitute the first Burke Hollow production area. The two Lower B trends have been proven to extend nearly 3 km. The north-western side of the orebody remains open-ended and only lightly explored, with good potential for extension for up to another kilometre, UEC said.
