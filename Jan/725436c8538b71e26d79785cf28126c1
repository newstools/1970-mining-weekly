ATHENS/TORONTO &ndash; Greece will seek arbitration to settle its differences with Canada&#39;s Eldorado Gold over gold mine developments, the country&#39;s energy ministry said on Thursday before the company&#39;s stock dropped more than 6%. Energy Minister George Stathakis has requested that the state&#39;s legal advisers prepare for the arbitration process to begin, the ministry said, without specifying terms or assets. Shares of Vancouver-based Eldorado declined 6.35% on the TSX to C$3.98. Eldorado is developing the Skouries and Olympias projects, in northern Greece, where it also operates the Stratoni mine. Skouries has been a particular flash point with authorities, with differences persisting for years over testing methods applied to comply with environment regulations. &quot;We have not received details on the arbitration other than what the Ministry has released on their website regarding their intentions,&quot; said a spokesperson for Eldorado, currently hosting an analyst mine tour in Greece. &quot;At this point nothing has changed with our development plans, outlook, etc.&quot; Eldorado said it will comment after receiving legal documents outlining the arbitration. &quot;The arbitration could in part be focused on the use of flash-smelting at the Skouries project, which has been central to some past disputes with the government,&quot; Scotiabank analyst Tanya Jakusconek said in a note to clients. &quot;The market will likely perceive that there is a risk of further project delays, particularly at Skouries.&quot; Greece says it wants to ensure that Hellas Gold, the Eldorado unit developing the projects, respects its contractual obligations. &quot;The aim is to safeguard public interest by developing the region&#39;s mineral resources in line with the existing environmental terms and standards,&quot; the ministry said in a statement. A ministry official told Reuters last week that the three-member arbitration panel would include government-selected judge, an Eldorado-selected judge and a third selected by the president of Greece&#39;sSupreme Court. Its decisions would be binding, but could be subject to further appeal. Early this year, Eldorado shelved expansion plans for its flagship Kisladag mine, in Turkey and deferred a development decision on a Brazil project, citing lower gold prices. It also operates in Romania. As gold miners seek less geopolitical risk in a lacklustre bullion market, Eldorado agreed to buy fellow Canadian mine developer Integra Gold last month for C$590-million. Integra&#39;s June 5 circular says Eldorado increased its bid and reduced its break fee after two other proposals emerged.
