MANILA - The Philippine environment minister has asked President Rodrigo Duterte to halt a second review of 28 mines that she ordered closed or suspended, challenging its legality despite initially supporting it. The U-turn by Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Regina Lopez comes as she faces pressure to defend her decision to shut more than half the country&#39;s mines, a move that prompted an industry outcry and concerns about lost revenue. The government&#39;s Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC), an inter-agency panel that includes the finance ministry, is conducting a review of the mines following criticism from miners that the original decision was baseless and lacked due process. &quot;The MICC is not mandated to do a review of any mining operation. The only agency that can do a review of mining operations is DENR, and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done,&quot; Lopez told Reuters, referring to her environment agency. Duterte&#39;s spokesman, Ernesto Abella, declined to comment on Lopez&#39;s latest move, saying it was not discussed in a cabinet meeting. Duterte, who last year warned miners to abide by stricter environmental rules or close down, has so far backed Lopez, a committed environmentalist, in the increasingly contentious dispute. She faces a Philippine legislative hearing set for Wednesday to confirm her appointment after an initial hearing was postponed last week. She is among just a few of Duterte&#39;s appointees yet to get the green light from lawmakers. Lopez on February 2 ordered the closure of 23 of 41 mines in the world&#39;s top nickel ore supplier and suspended five others to protect watersheds after a months-long review last year by the environment agency. Members of the MICC met a week later and agreed to a second review of the affected mines, issuing a joint resolution signed by Lopez and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez who co-chair the mining council. &quot;Whether I signed it or not the fact of the law is the law,&quot; Lopez said. The MICC was created through a 2012 executive order by former President Benigno Aquino and tasked, as part of its duties, to review mining laws and regulations and ensure their implementation. Lopez said she&#39;s challenging the review after learning that the second assessment will cost 50-million pesos ($1-million). &quot;I&#39;ve already done the review, what more do you want?&quot; she asked. Dominguez said he was surprised by Lopez&#39;s about-face, recalling that it was Lopez&#39;s lawyer who drafted the February 9 resolution, ABS-CBN News reported, citing Dominguez. Miners have contested the closure and suspension orders, which a mining industry group has said would affect 1.2 million people that depend on mining for their livelihood.
