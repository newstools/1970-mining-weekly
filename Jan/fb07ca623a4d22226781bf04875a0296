PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Potash developer Danakali has appointed a preferred power provider for its Colluli project, in Eritrea, following a tender process. US-based Inglett and Stubbs International has now been appointed as the preferred power provider, and Danakali said on Wednesday that work will now start on further refining and optimising the winning proposal and aligning the final requirements to the front-end engineering and design outcomes prior to finalising commercial terms of the engagement. A 2015 feasibility study estimated that the Stage 1 development of Colluli will require a capital investment of $442-million. The study examined a two-module development with an expected production of 425 000 t/y of sulphate potash for the first five years of operation, increasing to 850 000 t/y for the remainder of the proposed 30-year mine life.
