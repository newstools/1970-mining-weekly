JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The final phase of the midlife enhancement (MLE) project works at offshore gas deposit BassGas, which includes the installation and commissioning of a compressor and condensate pumping unit at the Yolla-A platform, had been completed ahead of time and within budget, ASX-listed AWE said on Friday. The company, which holds a 35% interest in the Tasmania-based project, noted that this followed the drilling and completion of, and gas sales from, the final two development wells, Yolla-5 and Yolla-6, in 2015. Compression of Yolla gas started on June 12, with production reaching the facility design capacity of 67 TJ/d on June 24, following a period of performance testing and system fine-tuning. AWE CEO David Biggs noted that this marked the end of the BassGas MLE project: &ldquo;We anticipate a significant improvement in BassGas production from July and we plan to start marketing our share of uncontracted gas from the Yolla field to prospective customers in 2018.&rdquo; Meanwhile, AWE is working with BassGas operator Origin Energy on the development of concept studies for the nearby Trefoil field, which is similar to the Yolla field in terms of gas-condensate mix. The completion of the MLE project triggers a cash payment of $2.5-million to AWE from Prize Petroleum, in line with the terms of the sale of an 11.25% interest in BassGas to Prize by AWE in 2014. The payment is not expected to be received until the next financial year.
