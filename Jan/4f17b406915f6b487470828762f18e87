JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The shareholders of triple-listed Coal of Africa Limited (CoAL) on Thursday gave the green light for the coal junior&rsquo;s buyout of Pan African Resources Coal Holdings, which owns the Uitkomst colliery, from JSE-listed Pan African Resources. Following a general meeting on Thursday, all resolutions required to implement the R275-million bid for the 50 000 t/m Uitkomst colliery, in KwaZulu-Natal, had been passed unanimously. The acquisition is considered complementary to CoAL&rsquo;s developing Makhado project. The Competition Commission earlier this month approved the proposed transaction. The transaction remains subject to the condition precedent that Uitkomst colliery enter into a supply of coal agreement on terms acceptable to CoAL.
