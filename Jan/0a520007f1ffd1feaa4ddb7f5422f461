JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Lithium project developer Novo Litio entered into a trading halt on the ASX on Thursday, pending the outcome of news regarding the status of its Sepeda project, in Portugal. The trading halt will be in place until Monday at the latest. Novo Litio, which was formerly known as Dakota Minerals, said in May that its scoping study for the Sepeda petalite project was nearing completion. The company believes that its petalite deposits in Portugal offer economic advantages over the spodumene deposits of Australia and Canada as they are closer to potential downstream processing locations in Europe.
