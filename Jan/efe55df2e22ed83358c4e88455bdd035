SANTIAGO &ndash; Chile central bank head Mario Marcel forecast subdued first quarter growth and said a &quot;more expansive&quot; monetary policy is necessary to meet inflation targets, according to a transcript of remarks he delivered to a think tank in Santiago on Tuesday. In a generally dovish speech, Marcel said economic growth figures in February and the first quarter as a whole will be affected by an ongoing strike at BHP Billiton&#39;s Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world&#39;s largest. He added that growth in the first quarter &quot;will not be better&quot; than fourth quarter 2016 figures, and that recent evolutions in the Chilean economy will affect the bank&#39;s next official growth projections, scheduled for release later in March. A more expansive monetary policy would be needed to reach the bank&#39;s 3% inflation target over the policy horizon, he said, a statement that adds to a number of dovish statements made by the bank in recent months. In January, Chile&#39;s central bank cut the benchmark interest rate 25 basis points to 3.25%. In February, the bank held the rate, but indicated that additional rate cuts were imminent. &quot;As was signalled in the December Monetary Policy Report, a more expansive monetary policy is necessary to reach the inflation target of 3% in 24 months in a context of weakening internal demand and exchange rate appreciation,&quot; Marcel said, referencing a report the bank puts out every quarter. &quot;We already concretised part of this greater expansiveness in January, when we reduced the interest rate by 25 basis points.&quot; Continued weak employment figures for salaried workers were &quot;worrying&quot; for the bank, Marcel added. The strike at BHP Billiton&#39;s Escondida mine, which produced about 5% of the world&#39;s copper last year, is nearing a month in length. The union and the company appear far from an agreement, and there have been incidents of violence in recent days. Copper is Chile&#39;s most important export by far, meaning mining disruptions can have a significant impact on growth.
