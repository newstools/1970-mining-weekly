EW DELHI &ndash; Indian-billionaire Anil Agarwal said on Monday he was happy with his personal 13% stake in mining company Anglo American and was just planning to keep it as an investment for now. &quot;I got the opportunity to take 13% share of that company because I also believe that India and Africa go hand in hand,&quot; Agarwal told a business summit. &quot;I have no other intention at the moment, just to be an investor ... I have taken a position. At the moment I am very happy with the 13%,&quot; he said. Earlier this month, Agarwal said he would buy a &pound;2-billion ($2.5-billion) stake in Anglo American and had no intention of taking control of the mining company.
