JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Global copper production growth will be supported by key markets with low operating costs and strong project pipelines in the next four years, according to research firm BMI&rsquo;s copper outlook report, released Monday.&nbsp; Global copper mine production, supported by markets and low operating costs, is forecast to increase by an average yearly rate of 4.1% between 2017 and 2021, as many major projects come on line. &ldquo;In terms of volume, we expect global copper output to climb from 20-million tonnes in 2017 to 23.7-million tonnes by 2021,&rdquo; said BMI in a statement. However, the research firm noted that a few developments will pose considerable risks to the copper mine outlook for 2017, namely labour unrest in Latin America and Freeport McMoRan&#39;s negotiations with the Indonesian government to resume copper exports from the Grasberg mine, which could result in lower-than-expected output. The Democratic Republic of Congo&rsquo;s (DRC&rsquo;s) copper production will return to solid production growth in 2017, supported by continued investment in high-grade reserves, the report says. &ldquo;The DRC will regain global copper ore market share of 5% by 2021, after falling to 4.7% in 2016.&rdquo; Chile, meanwhile, is expected to remain the leading global copper producer by a wide margin, though the nation&rsquo;s copper sector will face ongoing challenges, declining ore grades, freshwater shortages and labour unrest. &ldquo;Chile will account for a gradually declining share of the global total, from 27.2% in 2017 to 24.7% in 2021,&rdquo; said BMI. &ldquo;We forecast Chile to produce 5.4-million tonnes of copper in 2017, down slightly from 5.5-million tonnes the previous year, and to return to gradual production growth thereafter,&rdquo; the statement said. BMI further noted that China&#39;s copper sector will post steady production growth as miners contend with declining ore grades and a slow copper price recovery. &ldquo;We forecast China&#39;s copper production, which accounts for 9% of global output, to increase from 1.8-million tonnes in 2017 to two-million tonnes by 2021.&rdquo; Peru&#39;s copper sector, meanwhile, continues to post strong production growth as projects in the country come on line. Its total output exceeded two-million tons in 2016, thereby overtaking China as the world&rsquo;s second-largest copper producer. &ldquo;Peru&#39;s copper production will increase from 2.6-million tonnes in 2017 to 3.7-million tonnes by 2021, averaging 10.2% yearly growth.&rdquo; BMI added that competitively low operating costs and high-grade reserves will underpin Peru&rsquo;s copper production as copper prices remain subdued by historical standards. US copper production will increase from 1.4-million tonnes this year to 1.6-million tonnes in 2021. &ldquo;Environmental deregulation under US President Donald Trump will encourage project development in the copper sector,&rdquo; the report said.
