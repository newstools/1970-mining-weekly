PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A feasibility study into the restart of the Koolan Island iron-ore project, in Western Australia, has confirmed the projects economics, with ASX-listed Mount Gibson Iron now targeting first sales from the project in early 2019. The project, which was placed on care and maintenance at the end of 2014, would require a capital investment of some A$97-million to fund seawall construction and dewatering activities, with Mount Gibson saying on Thursday that the company would look to rebuild the Main Pit seawall, which is required to dewater the pit and restart production from the Main Pit deposit. The seawall construction, pit dewatering and all other activities to restart production is expected to take some 24 months to complete. &ldquo;After two years of extensive work to identify and confirm a safe and effective design and construction method for rebuilding the Main Pit seawall at Koolan Island, it is extremely pleasing to commence construction on what is undoubtedly one of the world&rsquo;s premier and most compelling high-grade iron-ore investment opportunities,&rdquo; said Mount Gibson CEO Jim Beyer. &ldquo;Coming shortly after extending the life of our Mid West operations, the redevelopment of Koolan Island also re-establishes Mount Gibson&rsquo;s status as one of Australia&rsquo;s premier high-grade producers at a time of rapidly growing demand for premium quality iron-ore products.&rdquo; Beyer noted that it also provides a long-term platform for further value creation. &ldquo;Our substantial cash reserves and cashflow from existing operations give us the capacity to undertake this investment without any need to take on debt for the project and still pursue other attractive opportunities which may arise in the months and years ahead.&rdquo; The initial main deposit is estimated to host an ore reserve of some 12.8-million tonnes, grading 66% iron, allowing for an initial mine life of three-and-a-half years and producing some 12.8-million tonnes of ore. However, Mount Gibson has identified potential Stage 2 pit extensions, as the company works to convert some seven-million tonnes of mineral resource to ore reserves at the east end of the Main Pit deposit. The mine will use the retained Koolan Island mining fleet, crusher, shiploader, accommodation camp, stores, workshops and administration buildings, while a total workforce of some 80 staff will be required during the initial seawall construction phase, rising to some 315 employees and contractors once the project is in production. The project is estimated to have a net present value of A$106-million and an internal rate of return of 34%, with a pay-back period of some 28-months from the first sale of ore.
