PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior gold miner Doray Minerals has reduced its net debt to A$23.4-million. The miner reported on Wednesday that at the end of June, it had cash and payable metals of about A$26.6-million with total debt of A$50-million. The company said it had received A$19.42-million from the sale of gold-copper middlings product from the Deflector mine, in Western Australia. Meanwhile, Doray has withdrawn from the Mt Fisher gold project, in Western Australia, after meeting its minimum expenditure requirement of A$1-million under an agreement with fellow-listed Rox Resources. Rox said it would review the results from Doray&rsquo;s exploration, particularly the zones of interest generated from the aircore drilling, and will consider its next steps at the Mt Fisher project.
