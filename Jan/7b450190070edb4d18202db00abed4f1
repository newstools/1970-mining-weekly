JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold exploration company Sula Iron &amp; Gold has completed a diamond drilling campaign at its flagship Ferensola gold project, in Sierra Leone, with a total of 14 drill holes for 3 788 m from select locations. The programme at the 100%-owned project resulted in four drill holes across the Sanama Hill target, seven drill holes across the TZ2 anomaly target and two drill holes on the TZ4 IP anomaly target. An additional step-out hole was completed that targeted the underlying geological formation at the Kuwait artisanal mining area that lies to the west of the TZ2 anomaly. A second and final batch of samples will be dispatched from camp on or around May 10. CEO Roger Murphy commented that the drilling programme increased the company&rsquo;s understanding of this &ldquo;very interesting&rdquo; orebody. &ldquo;The Kuwait hole is particularly interesting as it targets an area that was not part of our original planning for this phase and may point to an entirely new target.&rdquo;
