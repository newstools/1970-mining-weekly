PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; US oil and gas major Chevron was seeking special leave to appeal a A$340-million tax bill in the Australian High Court. The Full Federal Court in April dismissed the company&rsquo;s appeal of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) bill, ruling that the US-based company had used an intra-company loan as a means to shift profits offshore, and thus avoided paying income taxes in Australia. However, Chevron pointed out this week that the Federal Court had recognised that the company&rsquo;s financing was a legitimate business arrangement, and that the parties only differed in their assessment of the appropriate interest rate to apply. &ldquo;Chevron Australia pays a substantial amount of tax in Australia, including royalties, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, excise and interest withholding tax.&nbsp; Since 2009, we&rsquo;ve paid about $4.5-billion in federal and state taxes and royalties. &ldquo;We are one of Australia&rsquo;s largest investors and employers. In addition to tax payments, Chevron will continue to deliver substantial economic benefits for decades to come,&rdquo; the company said in a statement this week.
