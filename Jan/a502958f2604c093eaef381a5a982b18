MELBOURNE &ndash; Brazil&#39;s Vale is reassessing its loss-making New Caledonian nickel operations as part of a wider review of low performing assets after new Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman took charge last month, a spokesperson said. &quot;Under the leadership of our new CEO, Vale is reviewing all assets and operations, with low-performing assets an area of particular focus. Vale New Caledonia is part of that review,&quot; spokesperson Cory McPhee told Reuters by email. &quot;The nickel price today is languishing at around $9 000/t with no indication of recovery in the near-term. This has forced us to reassess all areas of the nickel business, including our operations in New Caledonia, which continue to lose money at these prices.&quot; Schvartsman has set up working groups to assess each of the business units at Vale, the world&#39;s biggest iron ore miner, and a report is expected within two months, according to analysts. Global nickel miners are coming under renewed pressure to cut costs or close capacity as a flood of cheap ore enters the market, and Vale has already said it plans to suspend two of its older high-cost Canadian mines this year. Indonesia and the Philippines are ramping up shipments after Indonesia relaxed an ore export ban earlier this year and a hardline Filipino environmentalist was ousted from the country&#39;s mining ministry. LME nickel reached a one-year trough of $8 680 last month and has since recovered to around $9 300. Vale has said that it is aiming to cut cash costs to $10 500 to $11 000 a tonne at its New Caledonia operations in the second half, as it ramps up production and prices of byproduct cobalt soar. France in November gave a 200-million euros ($227-million) state loan to Vale&#39;s New Caledonia unit to help it cope with pressure on nickel prices.
