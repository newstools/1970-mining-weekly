PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Arcadia lithium project, in Zimbabwe, could be in production as early as 2018, with a recent prefeasibility study (PFS) estimating that a capital investment of about $52.5-million would be required to bring the project into production. ASX-listed Prospect Resources reported on Monday that based on a maiden ore reserve of 15.8-million tonnes, grading 1.34% lithium oxide and 125 parts per million tantalum pentoxide, the project will be developed into a 1.2-million-tonne-a-year mining and processing operation with a mine life of 15 years. The PFS estimates that the Arcadia project will have an internal rate of return of 39%, and a pre-tax net present value of $139-million, with mine revenues expected to reach $2-billion over the life of the project. &ldquo;This result is a phenomenal outcome for Arcadia, our project team and importantly our shareholders,&rdquo; said Prospect chairperson Hugh Warner. &ldquo;In the space of less than a year, we have developed Arcadia to a stage where we have defined a globally significant deposit containing highly sought-after lithium products in spodumene and petalite.&rdquo; Warner said on Monday that Prospect was confident that Arcadia would have the ability to produce battery-grade lithium, glass and ceramic grade lithium and tantalite products to the market by late 2018. &ldquo;Following government environmental and financial approvals and coupled with excellent results of this PFS, the development of Arcadia can now be fast-tracked. This is undoubtedly supported by the very low startup costs, which further places Prospect at an advantage to its peers. &ldquo;Prospect can now actively pursue and execute offtake agreements and pursue funding options to develop this quality asset.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Warner pointed out that significant value could also be added through an ongoing PFS into a lithium carbonate and hydroxide chemical plant that would make Prospect a vertically integrated producer of lithium products. This PFS is due later this year.
