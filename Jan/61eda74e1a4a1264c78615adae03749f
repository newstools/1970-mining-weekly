JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Low-cost platinum group metals (PGMs) producer Sylvania Platinum&rsquo;s Sylvania Dump Operations (SDO) is on track to meet, and possibly exceed, full-year guidance of 63 000 oz to 65 000 oz of PGMs. The SDO delivered 17 096 oz of PGMs in the third quarter, ended March 31. Although this was 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, the preceding two quarters had delivered record output of a combined 35 819 oz. &ldquo;Financial year 2017, thus far, has been an excellent year in terms of production aided by slightly higher PGM feed grades, improved PGM recovery efficiencies and stable PGM feed,&rdquo; Sylvania said in a statement on Wednesday. The cash costs for the SDO in rand terms increased by 11% from R5 603/oz in the second quarter to R6 236/oz in the third quarter, as a result of lower PGM ounce production and slightly higher maintenance costs during the period. The 5% strengthening in the rand against the dollar over the period also contributed to a 17% increase in cash costs in dollar terms, from $402/oz to $471/oz.&nbsp; Revenue, however, increased by 10% in dollar terms to $12.8-million and by 5% in rand terms to R168.8-million. The higher revenue was, in part, driven by an 8% increase in the PGM basket price to $951/oz in the third quarter, from $881/oz in the second quarter. Capital expenditure (capex), meanwhile, rose by 134% to $1.6-million in the third quarter, compared with $684 000 in the second quarter, primarily as a result of the roll-out of Project Echo, which is expected to sustain production at 55 000 oz/y to 60 000 oz/y. The $12-million project will entail moving from single stream milling and flotation circuits at the Millsell, Doornbosch, Tweefontein, Mooinooi Dump and Mooinooi Run-of-Mine operations to primary and secondary milling and flotation circuits over a two to three year period. Sylvania has already spent $1.4-million on the project, with a further $2.4-million committed. &ldquo;Despite the ongoing capex requirements of Project Echo, the group remains cash generative,&rdquo; commented Sylvania CEO Terry McConnachie. Cash generated from operations before working capital movements was $4.4-million.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sylvania ended the quarter with a cash balance of $16.6-million, enabling it to internally fund Project Echo.
