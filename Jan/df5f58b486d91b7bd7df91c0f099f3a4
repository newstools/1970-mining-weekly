PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Queensland government on Wednesday introduced the Gasfields Commission and Other Legislation Amendment Bill to Parliament as part of a package of reforms to revamp the Gasfields Commission to better serve landholders, communities and the onshore gas industry during the next phase of gas development and production. &ldquo;The comprehensive reform package, including the new Land Access Ombudsman, will deliver better outcomes for all gas stakeholders,&rdquo; State Development Minister Dr Anthony Lynham said. &ldquo;The Bill introduced today is the first stage and will set up the Gasfields Commission to provide strategic direction and implement that better on the ground &ndash; in line with other independent statutory authorities.&rdquo; The changes are in response to an independent review of the Gasfields Commission, which made extensive recommendations to improve the negotiation of agreements and resolution of disputes between landholders and gas companies. The Bill will give the Gasfields Commission a more active role in health and wellbeing matters, delivering information and ensuring effective community engagement with health specialists and service providers, as well as changing day-to-day operations and community engagement, extension and communication undertaken by Commission. Furthermore, the amendments will also change the GM role to that of a CEO to reflect the broader responsibilities for the position when the chairperson and commissioners are appointed on a part-time basis. Lynham said the government was also separately proceeding with an alternate dispute resolution process and the establishment of the Land Access Ombudsman, which would be introduced to Parliament shortly.
