VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The TSX-listed stock of precious metals producer Primero Mining on Monday gained as much as 13.5% as investors anticipate a restart of the flagship San Dimas mine, in Mexico. The strike by unionised employees at San Dimas had halted mining and milling operations since February 15. The Toronto-based miner announced after market close on April 13 that it has successfully resolved the work stoppage at San Dimas, paving the way for a phased restart of operations. The company has reduced staffing at the mine by 17%, moved to a two-day shift schedule from three days and realigned the short-term bonus structure for the workforce. The new collective bargaining agreement runs until 2019. &ldquo;We view the news of the restart positively, but continue to be cautious on the name due to its current weak balance sheet. We would become more positive when we see a clearer path to San Dimas becoming free cash flow&ndash;positive and if Black Fox [in Ontario] can be shown to generate free cash flow on a sustainable basis,&rdquo; Desjardins Capital Markets analyst Michael Parkin said in a note to clients. Further, Primero said it has approved a 7.5% increase in workers&rsquo; base salaries, which are denominated in Mexican pesos. The company wanted to rework the bonus structure and move to a two-shift per day programme to improve productivity and availability at the mine, which should help the asset return to profitability. Primero closed 10.81% higher on the TSX on Monday at C$0.82 a piece, having shed about 26% in value since the strike began
