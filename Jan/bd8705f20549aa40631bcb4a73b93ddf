VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A supervisor has died at Codelco&rsquo;s Salvador mine, in Chile, following an accident at the flotation plant, the company reported Tuesday. The Chilean State-owned miner said its Salvador division immediately shut down the concentrator plan and started &ldquo;rigorous&rdquo; procedures such as informing the family, giving notice to the competent authorities and activating the investigation to determine the causes of the accident. Salvador produced about 60 000 t of copper in 2016, a 23% improvement over 2015, and 902 t of molybdenum. It is the smallest of Codelco&#39;s copper mines. Codelco did not indicate for how long the concentrator would remain suspended.
