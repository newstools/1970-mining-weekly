PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The first shipment of lithium direct shipping ore (DSO) from the Wodgina mine, in Western Australia, has set sail from Port Hedland, ASX-listed Mineral Resources reported on Tuesday. Mineral Resources purchased the Wodgina site in September last year, to mine and export around 1.5% lithium grade ore directly to processors in China. The company is hoping to export between 100 000 t/m and 200 000 t/m of DSO lithium. &ldquo;This shipment represents a major achievement for the Mineral Resources team and its partners. To develop a lithium mining operation and export its first product in the space of 49 days is an exceptional result,&rdquo; said Mineral Resources MD Chris Ellison.
