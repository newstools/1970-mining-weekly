PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Global energy firm Royal Dutch Shell has announced that the floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility for its Prelude operation has left South Korea on its way to Australia. On arrival at the Prelude offshore gas field, offshore Western Australia, the preinstalled mooring chains will be lifted from the seabed and secured onto the facility, followed by a commissioning process. The FLNG facility will produce some 3.6-million tonnes a year of LNG, 1.3-million tonnes a year of condensate and 400 000 t/y of liquefied petroleum gas. Shell said at the end of last week that the Prelude FLNG project was an important operation in the company&rsquo;s portfolio and would provide LNG for customers around the world. First cash flow from the project was expected in 2018. The project is operated by Shell, which holds a 67.5% interest in the project, with partners INPEX, Kogas and OPIC accounting for the balance.
