JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Edenville Energy has appointed a consultant mining engineer to oversee the mining development and efficient operation of its Rukwa coal-to-power project, in western Tanzania. The unnamed engineer has over 20 years of experience in the resources industry, including ten years on the continent, and comes from a strong background of putting mines into production, developing and operating mines and materials processing operations in Africa, Australia, Europe and the UK. Work has subsequently already started on mining equipment selection, recruitment of operations personnel and planning of mining development. Edenville has also appointed a consultant coal processing engineer to oversee the construction and operation of the wash plant including the training of Tanzanians. Meanwhile, the miner noted that it had further received letters of intent and expressions of interest from several parties that intend to buy coal from the operating mine on a long-term basis. Edenville noted that it was now conservatively planning for firm orders resulting in initial sales in the region of 5 000 t/m to 8 000 t/m, with the ability to increase production.
