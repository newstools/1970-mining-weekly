BENGALURU &ndash; Gold prices fell on Monday amid thin trading as the dollar firmed as the chance of a US government shutdown receded and as stronger equities dampened demand for non-interest paying bullion. Spot gold dropped 0.4% to $1 262.51/oz, as of 09:00 GMT. US gold futures also eased 0.4% to $1 263.90/oz. Many financial markets in Asia and Europe are closed on Monday for the Labour Day holiday. Asian stocks shook off a sluggish start and edged up on Monday, with Japan outperforming on upbeat earnings, while the dollar regained traction as the US government looked likely to avoid a shutdown. The dollar index rose 0.1% to 99.098. US congressional negotiators hammered out a bipartisan agreement on a spending package to keep the federal government funded through September 30, thus averting the first government shutdown since 2013. &quot;Interest around $1 262 restricted further declines to keep the metal within the recent range and we are likely to see this theme continue today with the UK on holiday,&quot; said Sam Laughlin, a trader with MKS PAMP Group. Last week, gold fell by 1.3%, the biggest weekly percentage decline since the week of March 10. But the metal ended the month about 1.5% higher. &quot;We see gold maintaining a relatively higher trading range in May as tensions with North Korea will command more attention now that the bearish impact of the French election is out of the way,&quot; said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. North Korea suggested on Monday it will continue its nuclear weapons tests, saying it will bolster its nuclear force &quot;to the maximum&quot; in a &quot;consecutive and successive way at any moment&quot; in the face of what it calls US aggression and hysteria. Meanwhile, hedge funds and other money managers increased their net-long position in COMEX gold for the sixth straight week to April 25, lifting it to a 5-1/2-month high, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed Friday. Money managers again cut their bullish stance in silver futures and options. Spot silver dropped 0.6% to $17.09/oz. It hit an 1-1/2-month low at $17.025 early in the session. Platinum fell 0.7% to $937/oz. It earlier touched a near three-week low of $934.50. Palladium was steady at $823.48/oz. It rose to an over two-year high at $831.50 on Friday.
