VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; As the British Columbia provincial election nears on May 9, the Mining Association of British Columbia (MABC), the Association for Mineral Exploration (AME), and Mining Suppliers Association of British Columbia (MSABC) launched the &lsquo;Vote Mining&rsquo; campaign on Thursday, to raise awareness about the importance of the sector to the economy and to encourage citizens to ask their candidates how they will support the province&rsquo;s mining industry. Votemining.ca is the campaign&rsquo;s official website and it provides British Columbians with the tools and knowledge to ask their candidates the important questions. The Vote Mining &lsquo;Take Action&rsquo; tool will also facilitate voters&rsquo; ability to write to their candidates and ask how they plan to support mineral exploration and mining in British Columbia. &ldquo;British Columbia&rsquo;s mineral exploration and mining industry remains a major driver for the provincial economy. As partners in the Vote Mining campaign, we wish to provide British Columbians with factual information that will showcase how important it is for candidates and voters to support such a critical industry that creates local opportunities for people living in every region of the province,&rdquo; stated AME president and CEO Gavin Dirom in a news release. MABC president and CEO Karina Bri&ntilde;o added that mining contributed an estimated C$7.78-billion to the local economy in 2015 and contributed C$476-million in payments to government, supporting important social programmes such as schools and hospitals. &ldquo;We urge British Columbians to seek further information through our Vote Mining campaign. Together, we have the potential to grow our industry and provide family-supporting jobs across British Columbia, and to continue our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and positive partnerships with communities and First Nations,&rdquo; she said. Meanwhile, MSABC president and CEO Alec Morrison said: &ldquo;The mining and mineral exploration industry directly and indirectly employs over 30 000 British Columbians in both rural and urban areas. It is important that every British Columbian let their local candidates know how vital this sector is for their province.&rdquo;
