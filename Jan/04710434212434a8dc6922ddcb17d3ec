JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; JSE-listed junior miner Keaton Energy&rsquo;s shares rose by 6.2% on Thursday, after it and Wescoal announced in a joint statement that the purchase price for Wescoal&rsquo;s takeover of Keaton had been adjusted. Subsequent to the signing of a firm intention offer letter in February, Keaton had issued a further 690 374 shares in terms of its employee ownership share schemes. As such, Wescoal and Keaton agreed to increase the aggregate scheme consideration from R525.59-million to R526.83-million, with a resultant increase in the cash component from R350-million to R351-million and the consideration shares from 87.59-million to 87.80-million. Upon completion of the deal during the first half of the 2018 financial year, Keaton will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wescoal and be delisted from the JSE. The transaction excludes Keaton&rsquo;s assets marked for disposal, namely Leeuw Mining and Exploration and Amalahle. Wescoal&rsquo;s shares also traded higher on Thursday, by 0.41%.
