LONDON &ndash; Glencore on Friday said it had bid for coal mines owned by Rio Tinto in Hunter Valley, Australia, offering $2.55-billion cash plus a coal price linked royalty, outbidding a previous offer from Yancoal. In January, Rio said it was selling its interest in Coal &amp; Allied Industries Limited to Yancoal Australia Limited for $2.45-billion. The terms of the deal allowed Rio to engage in negotiations with another party if Rio&#39;s board found &quot;a competing proposal is (or is reasonably likely to become) a superior proposal,&quot; Glencore said. It said its proposal, which was $100-million greater, met the criteria. Glencore said the proposal would be funded from existing cash resources and committed facilities, although it also said there was no certainty a deal would be agreed.
