JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A maiden resource for the Nkuluwisi prospect, located near the New Luika gold mine, in southwest Tanzania, is on track for delivery in the second quarter of 2017, Aim-listed Shanta Gold said on Wednesday. The reverse circulation (RC) drilling results of the Nkuluwisi mineralised target are currently being modelled, following which Shanta&rsquo;s independent resource consultants will review the results for a resource estimation. &quot;The grades and thicknesses of the mineralisation at Nkuluwisi are very encouraging. The deposit remains open at depth and strike, and we are confident that further exploration will add to the forthcoming expected maiden resource at Nkuluwisi due in the second quarter of 2017,&rdquo; Shanta CEO Toby Bradbury said in an update to shareholders. Nkuluwisi is located 12 km northwest of Shanta&rsquo;s New Luika central processing hub within the Lupa goldfields. The East Africa-focused gold producer, developer and explorer undertook a total of 44 RC drill holes, comprising 5 833 m of drilling, identifying mineralisation down to vertical depths of approximately 120 m below surface. &ldquo;Exploration to date has covered a strike length of about 900 m and significant portions of the regionally prominent Nkuluwisi shear zone remain untested and exploration work is ongoing,&rdquo; he said.
