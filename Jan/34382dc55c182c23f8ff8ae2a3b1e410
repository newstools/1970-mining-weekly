LIMA &ndash; Workers at Peru&#39;s biggest copper mine, Freeport-McMoRan&#39;s Cerro Verde, will resume work on Friday after voting to end a nearly three-week strike that had halved output, the union said on Thursday. The union accepted the company&#39;s offer to improve family healthcare benefits and pay workers their portion of the mine&#39;s profits earlier than usual, union leader Jesus Revilla said. The union has said that the strike had disrupted the mine&#39;s output of some 40,000 tonnes of copper per month, though the company said there was no material impact on production. The announcement follows the end to a historic 43-day strike at the world&#39;s biggest copper mine in neighbouring Chile last week. It comes amid expectations that Freeport might soon resume exports from its Grasberg copper mine, in Indonesia. Freeport owns a 53.56% stake in Cerro Verde. Sumitomo Metal Mining has a 21% stake in the mine, and Buenaventura 19.58%.
