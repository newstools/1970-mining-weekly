VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; An ongoing exploration campaign by Eritrea-focused base metals miner Nevsun Resources has extended the current Harena satellite deposit by 150 m beyond the current resource estimate. &ldquo;The new drilling demonstrates that the already sizeable Harena resource extends 150 m beyond its currently modelled limits, further enhancing the potential for underground mining. We are particularly encouraged by the increasing copper content which indicates the mineralising system is strengthening,&rdquo; CEO Cliff Davis commented. Nevsun said it has intersected 18.4 m grading 1.65% copper (Cu), 4.03% zinc (Zn0, 0.82 g/t gold (Au), 55 g/t silver (Ag), extending the deposit by 150 m. Meanwhile, borehole electromagnetic surveys suggest further down plunge extensions are likely. The drilling campaign has intersected 57.4 m of 0.37% Cu, 7.08% Zn, 0.17 g/t Au, 9 g/t Ag; 44.5 m of 0.49% Cu, 6.51% Zn, 0.43 g/t Au, 29 g/t Ag; 40.5 m of 0.76% Cu, 4.82% Zn, 0.18 g/t Au, 18 g/t Ag; and 84 m of 0.80% Cu, 4.72% Zn, 0.27 g/t Au, 15 g/t Ag. Further, Nevsun advised that preliminary versatile time-domain electromagnetic survey results highlight many new untested shallow drill targets. &ldquo;The recently completed airborne survey over the Mogoraib River and Tabakin exploration licences that were acquired in 2016, has highlighted a significant number of new shallow drill targets. Evaluation of the highest-priority anomalies is currently underway but the full suite of targets will take years to pursue. As we have always stated, Bisha is evolving into a large VMS [volcanogenic massive sulphide] district with exploration still in its infancy,&rdquo; Davis advised. Harena is located 10 km south of Nevsun&rsquo;s flagship Bisha processing plant, and drilling continues to expand the deposit at depth. Some of the results reported are part of an in-fill programme designed to upgrade the mineral resource and tighten the drill spacing at Harena to 100-m centres, while others are from an on-going programme focused on expanding the deposit. Nevsun believes that Bisha has &quot;untapped district-scale&quot; potential, with current deposits discovered including Harena, Bisha Main, Northwest Zone, Hambok and Asheli. An aggressive exploration programme is being undertaken at Asheli, Harena and Bisha Main.
