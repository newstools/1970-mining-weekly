PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Mount Cattlin lithium processing plant, in Western Australia, has reached its nameplate throughput capacity, completing its commissioning period ahead of schedule. ASX-listed Galaxy Resources told shareholders on Tuesday that, over the last seven days, the Mt Cattlin operation averaged 210 t/h during a 24-hour period and, over the past week, the final production rate averaged 378 t/d, with the best production day recorded in March at 488 t. Galaxy started production at Mt Cattlin in November 2016, and the miner is hoping to produce some 160 000 t of lithium concentrate during 2017. The company is also aiming to complete its 2016 contract offtake supply obligations, with the third lithium shipment from Mt Cattlin scheduled to arrive in April. Once this shipment has been concluded, all future volumes shipped will be on 2017 pricing terms, the company said. Additionally, all repayments advanced by current Chinese customers will be repaid after the upcoming shipment, meaning that all future shipments in 2017 would classify as revenue from lithium concentrate sales, and will flow directly to the company.
