JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; London-listed Gem Diamonds has recovered a high-quality 80 ct, D colour Type II diamond at its Let&scaron;eng mine, in Lesotho. This follows less than a month after the April 7 recovery of a 114 ct diamond from the mine. &ldquo;Although this 80 ct diamond is not of the very large size for which Let&scaron;eng is renowned, it is one of the highest-quality diamonds recovered at the mine and is entirely undamaged, making this a significant recovery,&quot; CEO Clifford Elphick said in a statement on Thursday.
