JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mineral explorer and developer Beowulf Mining is starting to put some scale to the mineralisation at its Aitolampi prospect, in Finland, with recent drilling having confirmed that electromagnetic anomalies are associated with wide zones of graphite mineralisation. The company, which trades on the Aim and Aktietorget, has reported a mineralised strike length of at least 350 m along the main conductive zone drill-tested, dipping between 40 &deg; and 50 &deg; to the south-west.&nbsp; The main electromagnetic zone extends for 700 m. Beowulf has sent composite samples for metallurgical testwork to SGS Mineral Services in Canada. The samples include an average grade composite for the main conductive zone, a higher-grade composite for the main conductive zone/near-surface mineralisation, and a higher-grade composite for the parallel conductive zones.&nbsp; Results are expected in the Northern Hemisphere summer. &ldquo;We look forward to the results of the metallurgical testwork on three composite samples, which will add to the current picture, and demonstrate what we can produce from Aitolampi, in terms of concentrate grades and flake size distribution,&rdquo; CEO Kurt Budge said in a statement detailing developments at its graphite portfolio in Finland. Budge stated that, on May 8, the company&rsquo;s exploration team had started a two-month field programme at Haapam&auml;ki, Pitk&auml;j&auml;rvi and Aitolampi, which included further Slingram E electromagnetic M surveys and geological mapping, with the objective of defining new drill targets.&nbsp; &quot;Over the summer, the team will be carrying out fieldwork on the company&#39;s Kolari and Viistola graphite projects, which will help us improve our understanding of both. Also, the fieldwork programmes will enable us to rank all our prospects and best allocate investment capital,&rdquo; he noted. Last week, Beowulf raised &pound;1.5-million to support its iron-ore, polymetallic and graphite activities in Sweden and Finland. Besides its graphite exploration portfolio, the company also owns the Kallak magnetite iron-ore project and the &Aring;tvidaberg polymetallic exploration licence in Sweden.
