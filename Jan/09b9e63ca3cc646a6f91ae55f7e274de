JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed copper miner Weatherly International&rsquo;s Tschudi mine, in Namibia, produced 3 236 t in the three months to March 31, 24% below nameplate capacity. This was a result of slower-than-anticipated leach rates for mixed oxide and sulphide ore stacked during the latter part of 2016 and early 2017, further exacerbated by above-average seasonal rains during the quarter, which prevented short-term acceleration of mining and stacking to compensate. However, as rain delays reduced heading into March the rate of stacking copper metal improved notably and these improved rates of stacking copper are expected to be sustained going forward. Weatherly still expects to produce between 14 500 t and 15 000 t of cathode for the financial year to June 30, as the rate of leaching is expected to recover during the June quarter.
