TORONTO (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Attendance at the Prospectors &amp; Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) 2017 convention totalled 24 161, a strong indication that confidence has returned to the mineral exploration and mining industry. &ldquo;The mineral exploration and mining industry is cyclical in nature and has faced a variety of economic challenges over the past several years, but optimism has always remained and it&rsquo;s fantastic to see this being reflected at the PDAC convention,&rdquo; PDAC president Glenn Mullan stated, referring to the sold out exhibitor space, the many investor meetings and short courses and the well-attended minerals outlook luncheon and awards gala. &ldquo;There was an upbeat vibe throughout the convention &ndash; a positive sign for the sector going forward.&rdquo; The PDAC, in partnership with the World Economic Forum, hosted the second International Mines Ministers Summit, bringing together 25 Ministers responsible for mining from around the world. The event provided an important setting for the global mining community to explore challenges and opportunities affecting the industry. This year&rsquo;s summit focused on innovation in the mining industry and the clean innovation agenda. At the summit, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr announced the renewal of the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit for one year, along with the maintenance of the flow-through share system. &ldquo;PDAC is seen as the voice of responsible mineral exploration and mining, not only in Canada but also abroad. We must continue to build strong working relationships, both nationally and internationally, and the PDAC convention is the best opportunity to make these connections and showcase our industry and its importance to socioeconomic development,&rdquo; PDAC executive director Andrew Cheatle said in a release. &nbsp;
