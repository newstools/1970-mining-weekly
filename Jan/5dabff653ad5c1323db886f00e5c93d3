PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Brazil-focused Crusader Resources has put into action an earlier nonbinding heads of agreement with Aim-listed Stratex International, announcing on Thursday that the two companies would merge. ASX-listed Crusader has now entered into a binding scheme implementation deed with Stratex, which would see the London-listed company acquire Crusader in an all-scrip transaction. Crusader shareholders would be given 6.6 common shares in Stratex, or 6.6 Stratex shares in the form of ASX-listed CHESS depository interests, for each Crusader share held, meaning that Crusader shareholders would hold an 81% interest in the combined company. The transaction implied a value of A$54-million for Crusader, and offered a 56.5% premium to the company&rsquo;s last trading price at May 17. &ldquo;We are delighted to move this exciting transaction a significant step closer to completion. Since announcing the heads of agreement in May, the merits of combining Crusader and Stratex have only become clearer,&rdquo; said Crusader chairperson Stephen Copulos. The Crusader directors have unanimously recommended that shareholders accept the offer, in the absence of a superior proposal, saying the combination with Stratex provided the potential for improved trading liquidity and capital market access, a listing on the London market, and access to a wider range of investors. Stratex&rsquo;s current cash balance of some A$10.9-million and its gold and base metals exploration interests, along with Crusader&rsquo;s own Borborema and Juruena gold projects, would create greater scale and asset diversity, Copulos said. As part of the transaction, Stratex will establish a secondary listing on the ASX to allow Crusader shareholders to trade on the bourse and will, subject to shareholder approval, undertake a consolidation of its issued capital on a 20-to-1 basis. Subject to the receipt of all the necessary approvals, the merger would likely be implemented in October.
