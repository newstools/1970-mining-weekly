PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Nickel miner Western Areas on Monday told shareholders that it was able to send the final shipment of nickel-in-concentrate to its customer in Asia, despite earlier fears that this would not eventuate. Western Areas last week warned some A$9-million in expected sales revenue could be moved from the 2017 calendar year to the 2018 calendar year, as crane maintenance at the Port of Esperance could result in an export shipment not crossing the ship&rsquo;s rail until early July, instead of its scheduled export date of late June. However, the miner on Monday said that the final June shipment from the Port of Esperance was made on June 30, as maintenance to the crane was completed ahead of plan.
