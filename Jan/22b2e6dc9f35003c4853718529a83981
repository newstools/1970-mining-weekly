JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Australian gold and manganese explorer Spitfire Minerals has confirmed the listing of its shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The listing is expected to help increase trading liquidity and to open up potential investment in Spitfire by institutional and retail investors in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, the company, which recently bought unlisted explorer Admiral Gold, reported on Friday. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange listing is also expected to help overcome time differences and account issues for European retail investors. Spitfire director Russell Hardwick said the Frankfurt listing supported the company&rsquo;s strategy to broaden its investor base, particularly in Germany where there was a growing interest in the company following the announcement of its acquisition of Admiral. Admiral has secured joint venture agreements over two highly prospective projects &ndash; the Alice River gold project, in north Queensland and the Mulwarrie gold project, in Western Australia. Spitfire&rsquo;s existing gold exploration portfolio includes the England gold project in the Laverton district of Western Australia and the Yoda prospect in the Northern Territory.
