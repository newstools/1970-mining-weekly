JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; London-based Kevin Tomlinson has been appointed nonexecutive chairperson of ASX-listed Plymouth Minerals, which is advancing a large-scale lithium/tin deposit in Spain. Current executive chairperson Adrian Byass will assume the role of MD. The company said in a statement on Thursday that Tomlinson had over 30 years&rsquo; experience in mining and finance within the Toronto, Australian and London stock markets and that his appointment to the board would add significant value to its assets. Tomlinson&rsquo;s previous roles include that of MD at Westwind Partners and the boards of Centamin and Medusa Mining. He is currently the nonexecutive chairperson of ASX-listed Cardinal Resources, which is developing a gold project in Africa. Plymouth is earning a 75% stake in the San Jose lithium/tin project in Spain by updating an historic feasibility study, which involves openpit mining and a simple process flow sheet to produce lithium carbonate on site. The company plans to lodge a mining lease application for San Jose in the third quarter of this year. Plymouth also owns potash projects on the coast of Gabon.
