LONDON &ndash; Physical gold demand globally rose to 1 895 t in the first half of 2017, up 17% from the same period last year, GFMS analysts at Thomson Reuters said. But the market saw a surplus of 138 t in the first six months compared with a balanced market in the same period last year, despite supplies shrinking more than 5% to 2 160 t. That was mainly due to physically-backed exchange traded funds, where demand fell to 145 t from 569 t. &quot;After the rollercoaster ride of events for the gold market in 2016, from a jewellers&rsquo; strike to Brexit to Trump to demonetisation, 2017 has avoided similar market moving events in the first half,&quot; GFMS said in a report on Thursday. &quot;The first half of this year has arguably been more of a reversion to normality . . . with neither the highs of ETF demand or lows of seriously struggling Asian demand.&quot; Demand in China, a top consumer, fell seven percent to 292.7 t. In India, another major market, demand nearly doubled to 307.6 t, ahead of a three percent tax levied from July 1. &quot;Given the introduction of the Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST) in India there is a relative hiatus in imports to that crucial market at present,&quot; GFMS said. &quot;This is leaving gold prices susceptible to softness, not least as it is often Indian demand that responds positively to price weakness.&quot; GFMS expects to see gold prices fall below $1 200 an ounce over summer in the northern hemisphere before recovering to average around $1 256 an ounce in the last quarter of 2017, due to a &quot;seasonal upturn in demand in Asia and a recovery in western investment&quot;. &quot;The latter may well be buoyed by geopolitical instability and/or potential correction to equity markets. Indeed, the S&amp;P 500 is already in its second longest bull run since World War Two,&quot; GFMS said.
