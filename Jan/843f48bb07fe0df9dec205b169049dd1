JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Kefi Minerals, along with the government of Ethiopia, have started resettlement arrangements for the Tulu Kapi community. &nbsp; &quot;Kefi and the government have worked diligently with the local community to ensure that they are supported and compensated appropriately throughout the resettlement process,&rdquo; executive chairperson Harry Anagnostaras-Adams said. Kefi is developing the Tulu Kapi mine, which will produce some 961 000 oz of gold over a 13-year mine life. Anagnostaras-Adams noted that all stakeholders recognise the value-added contribution the project is expected to make, especially to the community and district, including the provision of training and long-term jobs for over 500 people, a significant local economic multiplier effect, and the generation of over $1-billion of hard currency exports from an initial openpit operation. &quot;With this vital step now taken, we look forward to progressing with the final steps ahead before commencing construction,&quot; Anagnostaras-Adams said.
