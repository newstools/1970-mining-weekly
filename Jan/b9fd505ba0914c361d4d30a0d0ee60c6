JOHANNESBURG &ndash; Earnings estimates for South African stocks are at their highest ever, as analysts expect a major recovery in mining companies&rsquo; profits following a global rally in commodity prices in the past year. &ldquo;For the first time in five years, there&rsquo;s a good commodity cycle and the mining earnings were so depressed a year ago that they are coming off such a low base that they are shooting the lights out,&rdquo; Wayne McCurrie, head of portfolio management at Ashburton Investments, said by phone from Johannesburg. &ldquo;The answer, fundamentally, is mining companies - there&rsquo;s a massive turnaround in commodity share earnings; it&rsquo;s got little to do with South Africa - iron-ore has gone from $20 to $60, and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re making money.&rdquo; Earnings estimates for companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange climbed to a record on May 9. The All Share index has gained 6.7% year-to-date.
