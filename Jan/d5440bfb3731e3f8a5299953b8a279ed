VANCOUVER &ndash; Barrick Gold has earmarked $500-million over five years for upgrades and expansions to its Veladero mine, in Argentina, COO Richard Williams said on Tuesday, four weeks after a third cyanide solution spill at the mine. Barrick, the world&#39;s biggest gold miner, said improvements to the mine&#39;s processing facility, where the spills occurred, would include adding containment barriers, reinforcing and moving pipes, and installing new high-definition cameras to monitor the site.
