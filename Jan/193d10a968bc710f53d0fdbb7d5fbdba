PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Genesis Minerals is evaluating increased output at its Ulysses mine, in Western Australia, following a 36% increase in contained ounces. The company on Monday told shareholders that following recent drilling at the Ulysses project, the mine&rsquo;s total mineral resource has now increased to 2.8-million tonnes, grading 2.3 g/t gold for 206 400 oz of contained gold. This was a 32% increase in tonnage and a 36% increase in contained ounces compared with the previous resource estimate. &ldquo;Achieving a 36% increase in contained gold, net of depletion from two successful openpit mining campaigns is a very good result, which confirms our approach of unlocking value from the project using low-cost, toll treatment methods is viable,&rdquo; MD Michael Fowler said. Fowler said that Genesis was now evaluating the potential to undertake a further cut-back at the Ulysses West openpit, to extract a further 10 000 to of high-grade material, starting in June, with mining to take between four and six weeks. The most recent mining campaign at Ulysses West was recently completed, with a total of 7 500 t of high-grade material extracted. Adecision on a further cut-back at Ulysses West was expected by the end of May. In the meantime, the company is also evaluating the potential for a small-scale underground mining operation, to extract some of the deeper high-grade ore below the openpits. &ldquo;If we can identify a suitable pathway to progress this opportunity, we would envisage it would be undertaken using a similar partnership arrangement with an experienced underground mining contractor,&rdquo; said Fowler. If a suitable development pathway is identified, a feasibility study will be undertaken in the second half of 2017.
