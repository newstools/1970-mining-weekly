LUBIN &ndash; Shareholders in Polish state-run copper producer KGHM on Wednesday approved a dividend payout of 1 zlotys per share, in line with the management board&#39;s proposal. The dividend, which amounts to a total of 200-million zlotys ($52.6-million), is the lowest KGHM payout since 2001. KGHM, one of the world&#39;s biggest copper and silver producers, booked a net loss of more than four-billion zlotys in 2016 after writing down the value of its foreign assets. The Polish government, which holds a 31.8% stake in KGHM, has previously asked the company for higher dividends than management planned in an effort to boost state coffers.
