MOSCOW &ndash; Russia&#39;s top gold producer Polyus will offer new and existing shares in a secondary share offering in both London and Moscow, it said on Monday, in a deal that will test investor appetite for Russian assets. Polyus delisted from the LSE in late 2015 after Western sanctions over Moscow&#39;s role in the Ukraine crisis began to bite for Russian companies. However it returns to London, buoyed by an 11% rise in global gold prices this year and by a separate $887-million deal to sell 10% of the company to a Chinese consortium led by Fosun International. As part of its secondary share offering for 7% of the company&#39;s equity, Polyus expects to raise $400-million from the sale of new shares. Further proceeds from existing equity will go the company&#39;s controlling shareholder, the family of Russian tycoon Suleiman Kerimov. The company, listed on the Moscow Exchange with a market capitalisation of $9.9-billion and a free float of 6.76%, plans to use the proceeds from the planned share sale to repay some of its debt and finance projects. The Chinese deal had valued Polyus at $9-billion, or $70.6 per share, compared with 4 423 roubles ($78) per share at the market close on Friday. The shares were up 0.4% at 4 440 roubles on Monday. Other large Russian companies will be watching the Polyus offering with interest, hoping to gauge the likelihood of a robust return of investors that took flight after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The first $500-million-plus offering on the Moscow market this year could be followed by an initial public offering (IPO) from En+ Group, which manages Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska&#39;s aluminium and hydropower businesses, sources have told Reuters. State shipping company Sovcomflot is also expected to launch an IPO before long. Polyus, meanwhile, is looking for a successful share sale to boost funds after winning a licence in January for one of the world&#39;s biggest untapped gold deposits and as it prepares to start production at its large Natalka deposit in late 2017. &nbsp;
