JOHANNESBURG &ndash; Five people allegedly involved in widespread illegal mining of chrome in Limpopo are expected to appear in Sekhukhune and Mecklenburg courts on Monday. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspects aged between 33 and 44 were arrested last week during an operation by the police and the Department of Mineral Resources. &ldquo;Five TLBs [backhoe loaders], two trucks and two vans suspected to be used in the illegal mining activities were confiscated. Preliminary investigations indicate the machinery and the trucks were hired from Gauteng,&rdquo; Mojapelo said. &ldquo;We therefore issue a stern warning to the owners to first satisfy themselves about the purpose for which equipment is hired before concluding any transaction. Otherwise they run the risk of having their properties forfeited to the state for being used in the commission of crime.&rdquo; Loads of unprocessed chrome, ready to be loaded, were discovered at the sites in Mecklenburg and Malipsdrift.
