VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diamond explorer Tsodilo Resources has been granted an exploration permit in Botswana to look for diamond-bearing kimberlites in the prolific Orapa kimberlite field (OKF). The TSX-V-listed diamond and metals exploration company has gained access to one of the most significant diamond producing regions in the world, credited with producing 27-million carats a year in the last decade, and solidifying Botswana as the world&#39;s largest producer of diamonds by value. In 2016 alone, the OKF area produced 8.85-million carats. Tsodilo said the licence an initial effective date of January 1, and expires on December 31, 2019. The licence area covers 580 km2 and lies south of the Orapa and Damtshaa mines; west of the Letlhakane mine; about 20 km from the company&#39;s diamondiferous BK16 kimberlite pipe; and, it is next to, and near to Lucara Diamond Corp&rsquo;s high-value Karowe mine. Tsodilo advised that there are several known kimberlite bodies immediately next to the north and east of the licence block and an exploration programme has been designed to explore for yet-to-be-discovered orebodies. Tsodilo will also focus on the alluvial potential of this ground, as much of it occurs downstream of the diamond mines at AK06 and BK11. A detailed geomorphological analysis will be undertaken, paying particular attention to the paleo-drainage development of the region since the Cretaceous, when the OKF was emplaced. The company believes that despite denudation of the area has been limited, erosion has removed enough material from of the top of the kimberlites to release enough diamonds to form alluvial diamond placers close to the pipes.
