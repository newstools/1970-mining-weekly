BEIJING &ndash; Commodity company IRC on Wednesday said it was considering restarting its 1.1-million tonnes a year iron-ore mine in the far east of Russia, the latest sign of revival in a sector shaking a years-long downturn. &quot;Following the positive price movements in 2017 and the recent stabilisation in the bulk commodity market, the board is considering restarting Kuranakh, including options of potential cooperation with other parties,&quot; the Hong Kong-listed company said in a statement. The Kuranakh mine, in Russia&#39;s Amur region, was producing about 1.1-million tonnes of iron-ore concentrate each year before it was placed under care and maintenance in early 2016. It was also churning out about 200 000 t/y of ilmenite, a titanium ore. Iron-ore prices have surged 30% and ilmenite by 150% since the mine was suspended, the company said. However, the statement comes at a time when futures prices in China have toppled off record highs hit in recent months, dampened by concerns about a slowdown in demand in the world&#39;s top importing nation and a growing glut as stockpiles. The most-active Chinese iron-ore futures have fallen by about 30% since hitting record highs of 650.5 yuan ($94.49) per tonne in February. Rocketing prices prompted some Chinese producers to reopen mines after suffering years of tepid demand.
