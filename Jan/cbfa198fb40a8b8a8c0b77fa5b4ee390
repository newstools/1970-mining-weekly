SYDNEY &ndash; Activist shareholder Elliott Management called on BHP on Wednesday to &quot;upgrade&quot; its board of directors as the mining giant prepares to select a new chairperson this week. &quot;BHP has an entrenched board, with long-tenured directors having approved the disastrous acquisitions and poorly timed share buybacks that are at the root of much of today&#39;s underperformance,&quot; Elliott said in a statement. &quot;A significant upgrade in directors is needed.&quot; Elliott, a New York-based fund that has built up a 4.1% stake in BHP, has maintained a barrage of criticism of the global miner since releasing a list of changes it wants at the company, including an exit from its US oil shale business. BHP&#39;s board of directors is currently meeting in Chile, home to the company&#39;s vast copper mining business, where it is expected to select a new chairperson. Australian wealth management group Escala and fund Tribeca Investment Partners have also campaigned for a revamp at the company, with calls for board changes and reviews of the energy divisions. In a note last week, AMP Capital, one of BHP&#39;s largest shareholders, called on the miner to conduct an &quot;independent assessment&quot; of Elliott&#39;s proposal to unify BHP&#39;s dual-listed company structure and to &quot;prove the worth of its US onshore business and why it is compatible in the BHP portfolio.&quot; BHP was not immediately available to comment.
