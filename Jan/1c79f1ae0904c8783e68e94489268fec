JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Greenland-focused graphite miner Alba Mineral Resources has completed its consultation phase with the country&rsquo;s Mineral and Licensing Safety Authority, allowing it to embark on a work programme at its Amitsoq project. The programme, to take place over June and July, is designed to verify the priority graphite target zones identified in last year&#39;s extensive electromagnetic (EM) survey over the licence area, which delineated more than 12 km of strike length. In addition, the programme will target known gold, platinum-group element, nickel and copper anomalism within the licence, which was identified during an extensive historic data capture exercise undertaken by Alba&#39;s technical team involving a review of all historical exploration data available for the licence area. Graphite will remain the focus of the programme, as Amitsoq&#39;s previously announced graphite grades, of more than 25%, remain among the highest of any project in the world. Geological mapping will be performed in and around the historic mine site to accurately determine all graphite beds in the area. Thicknesses, dips and strikes will also be documented and cross-checked against the detailed geophysical data obtained during the extensive airborne EM and magnetic survey. &nbsp; Samples of all graphite beds of potentially economic thickness will be collected and submitted for laboratory analysis. All outcrops will be measured for resistivity and susceptibility, and this data will again be cross-checked against the airborne geophysical data. The field programme will be funded from the company&#39;s existing resources.
