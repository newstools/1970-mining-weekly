JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; An updated prefeasibility study (PFS) on TSX-V-listed Amarillo Gold&rsquo;s Mara Rosa project, in Brazil, has demonstrated improved economic metrics, compared with a 2011 study, including a rapid after-tax payback period of just over two years. The updated PFS investigated two mining scenarios &ndash; owner-operated and contract mining. The contract mining scenario has now been selected as the base case, owing to its lower initial capital expenditure requirement, estimated at $148-million, and higher internal rate of return (IRR) of 35.2%. The updated PFS indicated a net present value, using a 5% discount rate of $178-million, with cash operating costs estimated to be $545/oz and all-in sustaining costs at $627/oz. The mine, which will be a single openpit operation, is expected to produce 140 000 oz/y of gold over the first four years, with the average life-of-mine production projected to be 112 000 oz/y over eight years. The project is expected to have a positive impact on the gross domestic product of the surrounding region, generating over $1-billion of gross revenue and contributing about 300 permanent jobs over its mine life. &ldquo;This updated PFS firmly establishes superior economics for our Mara Rosa project. The project benefits from being a simple, openpit, proposed mining operation with a rapid after-tax payback period of only two years. &ldquo;Amarillo is pleased to be in the pro-mining state of Goias where we are surrounded by excellent infrastructure and multiple operating mines,&rdquo; commented Amarillo CEO Buddy Doyle.
