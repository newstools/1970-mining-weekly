PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mineral sands developer Sheffield Resources has signed two offtake memorandums of understanding (MoUs) over future production from its Thunderbird project, in Western Australia. &ldquo;The MoUs have been signed with zircon consumers with a high standing in the industry, confirming Sheffield&rsquo;s capability of supplying the global market with very high-quality products once in production,&rdquo; said MD Bruce McFadzean. He noted that the recent bankable feasibility study into the Thunderbird project confirmed that zircon would represent 62% of the estimated project revenues. The MoUs were nonbinding and signed with European ceramics company CFM Minerals. The combined agreements represented up to around 20% of the estimated total volume of premium zircon to be produced from Stage 1 of the Thunderbird project. The A$271-million Stage 1 development was expected to have an 8.5-million-tonne-a-year throughput, doubling to 17-million tonnes a year in year five of operation, with the investment of a further A$195-million. Over its 42-year mine life, Thunerbird is expected to deliver some 76 100 t/y of premium zircon, 68 500 t/y of zircon concentrate, 387 800 t/y of ilmenite and 229 800 t/y of titano-magnetite. McFadzean said on Tuesday that, in conjunction with the MoU arrangements, Sheffield was also working with its financial adviser to progress funding for project development.
