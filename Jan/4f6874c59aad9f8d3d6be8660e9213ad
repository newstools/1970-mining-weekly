PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The South Australian government has welcomed the public submissions received for its review of the state&rsquo;s mining law, with Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis saying on Monday that the responses would be used to guide the legislative response to the issues raised. &ldquo;It was great to see how well the community engaged with this process, with more than 130 submissions received from industry groups, landowners and community leaders,&rdquo; Koutsantonis said. &ldquo;To ensure the review process remains open and transparent, submissions are now available to the public online along with a series of booklets and information sheets that summarise the state government&rsquo;s initial response to your feedback.&rdquo; The state government in September last year launched a review of its three major mining laws, in an effort to modernise the legislation. The mining laws being reviewed include the Mines and Works Inspections Act, the Mining Act, and the Opal Mining Act. As part of this review, a six-month public consultation process was undertaken to elicit views from landowners, industry participants, regional communities, explorers and mine operators.
