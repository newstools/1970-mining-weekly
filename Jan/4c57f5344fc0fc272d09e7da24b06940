JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Premier African Minerals&#39; offer, made on Friday, to raise &pound;1.5-million, at 0.5p per new ordinary share, received a very strong response from private and institutional investors, with the offer being oversubscribed. The offer was on a first come, first served basis and was closed early on March 26, once &pound;2-million had been surpassed and the offer having already been 34% oversubscribed by that time. Premier will issue and allot 402-million ordinary shares at an issue price of 0.5p each to satisfy the offer. CEO George Roach said the company was pleased with the support it received from investors. &ldquo;This fundraise enables expedited execution of the additional drilling that is under way at Zulu Lithium and our limestone deposit in Mozambique. When [our] RHA [mine] meets its guidance and a liquidity event occurs at Circum, we are unlikely to need further operational funding for any operations at any existing projects in the current calendar year.&rdquo;
