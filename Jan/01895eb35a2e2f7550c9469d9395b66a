VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Persistent snowstorms that cut off access to junior miner Cerro Grande Mining&rsquo;s high altitude Pimenton mine, in Chile, from the outside world has now been permanently shuttered. Toronto-based Cerro Grande cited Friday a lack of adequate working capital and a series of snow storms that have and will affect operations at the mine as the main reasons for closing the 100%-owned mine. All personnel have been taken out of the mine. The company could not give a date in the future when mining operations could restart. Pimenton produced 4 256 oz of gold in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, down from 6 633 oz produced in the prior year. For the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, Pimenton produced 932 oz of gold. The closure leaves Cerro Grande without an operating asset ad it is currently investigating all alternatives for raising more working capital.
