SAO PAULO &ndash; Brazilian miner Vale said on Friday the US District Court for the Southern District of New York annulled the majority of a class action lawsuit against the company and executives over the collapse of a tailings dam in Brazil in 2015. The only parts of the case that remain ongoing are linked to specific statements made by Vale in 2013 and 2014, and a conference call in November 2015, the company said.
