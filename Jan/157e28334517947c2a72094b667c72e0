JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Frontier mine, owned by Eurasian Resources Group (ERG), has delivered more than 107 000 t contained copper in concentrate in 2016, an 35% year-on-year increase in output. ERG on Wednesday said the growth at its flagship mine, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), came on the back of its revised production plan, launched in late 2015, which sought to increase long-term copper production by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its operating model. Frontier GM John Robertson said the production figures were encouraging. &ldquo;This is a major step forward for the group and supports ERG Africa&rsquo;s strategy to become a regional copper and cobalt champion.&rdquo;
