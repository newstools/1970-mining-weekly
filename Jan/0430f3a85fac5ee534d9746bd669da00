PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed junior Metalicity is hoping to bring forward production at its Admiral Bay zinc project, in Western Australia, with the introduction of an ore sorting technique. The company said on Monday that it would undertake a detailed assessment programme of the ore sorting technique as part of the prefeasibility study (PFS) being undertaken at the Admiral Bay project. By deploying the ore sorting technique there was potential to remove up to 50% waste material for the subsequent concentrate product, and, as a result, a significant reduction in capital expenditure around hoisting, processing and infrastructure for the Stage 2 concentrate model. &ldquo;The testwork and application of the ore sorting technique has the potential to deliver a direct shipping ore product from the high-grade zone as a Stage 1 starter mine, which will bring forward production, accelerate cash flow and substantially reduce preproduction capital,&rdquo; said Metalicity MD Matt Gauci. He noted that the ore sorting technique, in conjunction with the new drilling techniques employed in the PFS, would significantly reduce the capital intensity to develop and mine the Admiral Bay project. &ldquo;These factors along with existing studies on geotechnical, hydrological and metallurgical studies are key success factors to unlock the significant value that exists within the Admiral Bay project, and work is progressing on all fronts.&rdquo;
