PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Takeover target Lepidico has signed a binding term sheet with Grupo Mota over the Alvarr&otilde;es lepidolite mine, in Portugal. Under the terms of the agreement, Lepidico will spend a minimum of &euro;250 000 on exploration and drilling at Alvarr&otilde;es over an 18-month period. Exploration will include the evaluation of material from waste dumps, tailings and mine spill. Lepidico will aim to delineate a Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource as potential feed for future L-Max processing facilities. Lepidico is the owner and developer of the hydrometallurgical L-Max process, which involves the direct atmospheric leaching of lithium mica, and impurity removal stages with subsequent lithium carbonate precipitation. Unlike other lithium extraction processes, L-Max does not require large tracts of land for evaporation ponds. It also eliminates the need for costly pyrometallurgical processing. &ldquo;The company is very much looking forward to working with Grupo Mota, one of Europe&rsquo;s most highly respected and long-established ceramic industry suppliers. With successful exploration at Alvarr&otilde;es, we hope to identify significant additional feed material for our future L-Max facilities and Grupo Mota&rsquo;s ceramics business,&rdquo; said Lepidico MD Joe Walsh. Lepidico is currently the target of a takeover offer from fellow-listed Lithium Australia, which is offering one of its own shares for every 13 Lepidico shares held. Lepidico has urged shareholders not to take any action on the unsolicited bid.
