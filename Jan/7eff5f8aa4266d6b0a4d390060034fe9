SYDNEY &ndash;&nbsp; After what&rsquo;s been a tough quarter, iron ore&rsquo;s getting a small reprieve. Futures clawed their way back above $60 a metric ton and spot prices have rebounded from a one-year low as steel output holds up in China, buoying demand for the material even as its supply rises. The SGX AsiaClear contract rallied as much as 3.1% to $61.43 a ton, the highest in five weeks, while futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange held gains. On Tuesday, benchmark spot ore with 62% delivered to Qingdao surged 5.2% to $59.70 a dry ton, according to Metal Bulletin. Miners shares advanced, including BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The commodity&rsquo;s uptick this week has pared losses seen this quarter spurred by concerns about rising production, especially of low-cost supply, and China&rsquo;s moves to rein in leverage. Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday that Asia&rsquo;s top economy is on track to meet growth targets. Both steel coil and rebar in China are headed for gains in June after a multi-month run of losses. &#39;GAINING FAVOUR&#39; &ldquo;After the recent sell-off, iron-ore&rsquo;s due for a rebound and is gaining favour with funds,&rdquo; Maike Futures Co. analysts Dang Man and Ren Jiaojiao said in a note. &ldquo;An improvement in profit margins has incentivised steelmakers to sustain production,&rdquo; they said. China makes half of the world&rsquo;s steel. Steel extended gains on Wednesday, with reinforcement-bar futures closing 1.7% higher in Shanghai, and hot-rolled coil adding 1.2% to a three-month high. Spot iron ore, which bottomed at $53.36 on June 13, remains 26% lower this quarter, the most since the first three months of 2015. Miners climbed in Sydney. Rio Tinto rose 2.5% as BHP Billiton added 1.9%, with both stocks capping their fifth consecutive daily gain. Fortescue Metals Group increased 4.1%, up for a third session. They are Australia&rsquo;s biggest exporters.
