SANTIAGO &ndash; Chile&#39;s state-run Codelco, one of the world&#39;s biggest copper producers, is readying a domestic bond issue that will allow it to refinance its debt and fund investments, a local ratings agency said on Thursday. Codelco was in the process of registering a new debt issue worth some $1.6-billion, denominated in Chilean inflation-adjusted currency unit UF, said Feller Rate in a statement, adding that it was rating the bonds &#39;AAA&#39;. The company, which returns its profits to the state and is funded by a mix of government refinancing and debt, needs to invest billions of dollars in an ambitious program to expand its tapped-out mines. Codelco confirmed that it was registering the new bonds, but added that an issue was not necessarily imminent.
