VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Base metals miner Imperial Metals has significantly reduced operations at its Mount Polley openpit copper/gold mine, in the Williams Lake area of British Columbia, as about 17 &quot;wildfires of note&quot; rage in four of the province&rsquo;s six fire management centres, posing a threat to public safety. Many of the roads used to access the mine site are currently closed and, should critical supplies such as fuel not be available owing to road closures, the mine may be forced to suspend operations, the company said in a statement. Employees who have been able to report for work have been reassigned to maintain mill operations at the expense of mining operations, which have been significantly reduced. Imperial pointed out that many employees at its Red Chris mine also live in the Williams Lake area, and have been evacuated from their homes or are on evacuation alert. With the temporary closure of the Williams Lake airport, Red Chris charter flights from Williams Lake to Dease Lake have been cancelled. The company is reorganising its crews and adjusting charter flights into Dease Lake to maintain staffing levels at the Red Chris mine. Canada&rsquo;s largest diversified miner Teck Resources said on Monday that none of its operations in the province had been impacted by the wildfires. Meanwhile, several lumber mills, including West Fraser Timber, Norbord and Tolko Industries have said their respective operations have been impacted by the wildfires in the region and that their mills will be closed on Monday.
