JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash;&nbsp;Sierra Leone-focused exploration company Sula Iron &amp; Gold has signed a new 5 000 m drilling contract with Equity Drilling on its flagship Ferensola gold project. Drilling will primarily focus on the TZ0 Sanama Hill targets. &nbsp;&nbsp; The programme will aim to infill and extend the areas of known high-grade mineralisation and to improve the confidence in the geological interpretation as well as support a more accurate determination of the contained gold.&nbsp; &quot;We are pleased to be able to announce a further drilling programme focused on Sanama Hill, also aimed at the other compelling targets touched upon by our recently completed programme,&rdquo; CEO Roger Murphey said. Sula may also undertake further scout drilling on targets within the Ferensola licence. The scout drilling will be designed around the pending second-batch assay results, and after the completion of a review of all data collected to date by Tect Geological Consulting, a South African structural geology firm.
