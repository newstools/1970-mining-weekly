SOCH &ndash; The takeover of India&#39;s Essar Oil by Russia&#39;s largest oil producer Rosneft can be now considered as closed, Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin told a shareholders&#39; meeting on Thursday. The deal, where Rosneft will hold a 49% stake, will allow the Russian company to increase oil refining output by 20% this year, he said. Sechin also said that the synergy effect from the privatisation of oil company Bashneft had totaled more than 40-billion roubles ($669.9-million) in the first two quarters of this year. Rosneft&#39;s gas production is set to be rising by more than 10% a year, Sechin said, while overall investments are seen at more than one-trillion roubles annually in the coming years.
