PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) has approved ASX-listed Yancoal&rsquo;s $2.45-billion acquisition of Rio Tinto subsidiary Coal &amp; Allied. The two companies in January struck a deal that will allow for an initial $1.95-billion cash payment upon the completion of the transaction in the second half of 2017, followed by $500-million in deferred cash payments to be settled in five yearly installments of $100-million. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s FIRB approval is a positive step forward for Yancoal, its shareholders and the Hunter Valley, demonstrating the Australian government&rsquo;s support for continued investment into the local resources sector,&rdquo; said Yancoal CEO Reinhold Schmidt. &ldquo;Yancoal remains a key provider of employment, training and investment within New South Wales and we look forward to continuing to grow our operations.&rdquo; The transaction was still subject to a number of conditions, including shareholder approvals.
