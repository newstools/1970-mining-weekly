JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Slovakia Main Mining Bureau will re-issue an underground mining permit for Ortac Resources&rsquo; &Scaron;turec gold project. This will allow for a restart of the mine, which had historically been mined by State-owned companies. A 2013 prefeasibility study on the project had estimated a net present value, at an 8% discount rate, of $195-million and an internal rate of return of 30%. The mine has a projected life of 11 years, with average production of 71 000 oz/y of gold equivalent.
