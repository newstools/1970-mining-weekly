JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Platinum mining company Lonmin has bought the remaining 7.5% stake in Pandora from Northam. The London- and Johannesburg-listed company, which is headed up by CEO and COO Ben Magara, said on Monday that it was buying the stake from Northam&rsquo;s Mvelaphanda Resources for R45.5-million cash and refunding the value of any cash calls paid by Mvelaphanda to the Pandora JV during the period from January 1 and completion of the deal, which are expected to total between R6-million and R8-million. Lonmin, which has also agreed to acquire Anglo American Platinum&rsquo;s 42.5% equity interest in the Pandora JV, is currently in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for this acquisition, which it anticipates will be completed this year. Completion of the two transactions will result in Lonmin increasing its ownership in the Pandora JV to 100% from its current 50% holding through its Eastern Platinum subsidiary. The rationale of the deal is to consolidate its position in what is a relatively shallow and high-grade mineral resource, providing an attractive option for development by Eastern Platinum. Lonmin will be able to access a portion of the Pandora mining right from its adjacent Saffy shaft, allowing it to defer R1.6-billion of capital expenditure (capex) at the Saffy shaft from 2018 to 2020 while maintaining full production at that shaft. It will also be able to defer a further R1-billion capex thereafter. In the longer term, Lonmin will also have the option to optimally develop this shallow, high-grade resource as and when supported by market conditions.
