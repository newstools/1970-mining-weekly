JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; To accelerate the development of its Poland-based Debiensko hard coking coal project and advance preconstruction engineering works at its Jan Karski mine, dual-listed Prairie Mining has secured $2-million in funding from its cornerstone investor CD Capital Natural Resources Fund. The investment will take the form of a private placement of nonredeemable, non-interest-bearing convertible loan notes and is upsized from a previously announced A$2-million. &quot;The additional investment reaffirms the global significance of our tier one coking coal assets. We are delighted with the continued support from our cornerstone investor who shares Prairie&#39;s vision to become Europe&#39;s next strategic coking coal supplier,&rdquo; said CEO Ben Stoikovich.
