BERLIN &ndash; Burglars stole a 100 kg (220 lb), solid-gold coin worth $4-million from a Berlin museum in a heist out of a Hollywood movie. A security guard at the Bode Museum alerted police early Monday morning that the coin &ndash; which carries Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s imprint and is called &quot;Big Maple Leaf&quot; &ndash; had been removed from its case. The perpetrators were able to circumvent the alarm system, the museum said in a statement. A ladder was found on nearby local train tracks which may have been used in the plot. The coin is as big as a car tire. It was issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 and was the biggest gold coin at the time, German public broadcaster RBB reported on its website. There are only five coins of that type. It&rsquo;s been on display in the museum since 2010, on loan from a private owner.
