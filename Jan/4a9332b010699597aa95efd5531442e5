PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Heron Resources has awarded a A$107-million engineering, procurement and construction contract with project house CIMIC for the 1.5-million-tonne-a-year mineral processing plant and associated infrastructure at the Woodlawn base metals project, in New South Wales. &ldquo;This contract award follows the successful undertaking of a front-end engineering design programme that included a value engineering approach incorporating significant improvements on the earlier feasibility study work,&rdquo; said Heron MD and CEO Wayne Taylor. &ldquo;The nature of this contract, which included guaranteed maximum price and performance incentives, aligning CIMIC and Heron in delivering an under-budget and early result.&rdquo; Work on the contract is expected to start in mid-2017. Heron meanwhile said that full project engineering is around 20% complete, and on-site work is scheduled to start immediately following the completion of project financing. Woodlawn is expected to produce 40 000 t/y of zinc, 10 000 t/y of copper and 12 000 t/y of lead, over an initial mine life of 9.3 years, with potential to extend the mine life to more than 11.5 years. The project will process one-million tonnes a year from underground mining and up to 1.5-million tonnes a year from reclaiming tailings, with two production sources providing operational flexibility and reducing risk. Heron is hoping to start production in 2018.
