JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash;&nbsp;Recent coal quality testwork undertaken at coal miner Prairie Mining&rsquo;s Jan Karski mine, in Poland, has established the mine&rsquo;s potential to produce high-value ultralow-ash semisoft coking coal (SSCC). Independent analysis by coal market consultants estimates that the mine&rsquo;s ultralow-ash SSCC would potentially realise a 10% premium to international benchmark SSCC prices. &ldquo;The expanded washability and coking analysis from the recently drilled cycow 9 borehole has confirmed that a high-value ultralow-ash SSCC can be produced from Jan Karski at a product yield of 75%,&rdquo; CEO Ben Stoikovich said in a statement. He highlighted that this transforms the mine into a predominantly coking coal project with superior SSCC qualities. &ldquo;Preliminary discussions with select European steelmakers have confirmed the suitability of ultralow-ash high SSCC to be used in coke oven blends,&rdquo; he said.
