JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Multicommodity resource and development company Premier African Minerals is preparing to mark its first shipment of wolframite concentrate from the newly upgraded plant at its RHA tungsten mine, in Zimbabwe, to Durban, South Africa. This followed the Aim-listed group&rsquo;s receipt of all the required permits from the relevant Zimbabwean authorities, Premier said in an update to shareholders on Thursday. Premier has been undertaking plant upgrades at the tungsten mine over the past few months, completing the transition in March after the installation of an X-ray transmission (XRT) sorter in February. The XRT sorter had exceeded the company&rsquo;s expectations, proving capable of recovering up to 100% of mineralisation contained in the run-of-mine feed to the sorter, on a continuous basis and in a mass pull of about 5% on average, CEO and chairperson George Roach said at the time.
