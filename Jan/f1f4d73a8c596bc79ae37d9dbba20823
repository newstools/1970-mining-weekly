LUSAKA &ndash; A row that saw a State-owned Zambian company sue Canadian miner First Quantum Minerals for $1.4-billion is likely to be resolved by June, the southern African nation&#39;s Presidency said on Saturday. First Quantum asked a Zambian court in February to dismiss the suit from Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings (ZCCM-IH), which is 77% State-owned and holds minority stakes in most of the country&#39;s copper mines. Presidential spokesman Amos Chanda told Reuters the Finance Minister had written to First Quantum and the company agreed to begin talks with the government on May 30. &quot;Finance Minister Felix Mutati has prescribed that the talks should finish within seven days and a government negotiating team headed by the secretary to the Treasury will be announced soon,&quot; Chanda said. &quot;First Quantum has informed me that their technical team will attend the negotiations and they are confident that an amicable settlement will be reached,&quot; he said. President Edgar Lungu called earlier this month for an out-of-court settlement in the case. Zambia is Africa&#39;s second-largest copper producer and differences with mining companies over taxes, electricity prices, environmental concerns and labour matters often arise. The $1.4-billion claim by ZCCM-IH includes $228-million in interest on $2.3-billion of loans it claims First Quantum wrongly borrowed from the Kansanshi Copper Mine, as well as 20% of the principal amount, or $570-million. ZCCM-IH said in court papers filed in October that First Quantum used the money as cheap financing for other operations. First Quantum says the loans were at a fair market rate.
