JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A financing agreement between Aim-listed miner Vast Resources and SSCG Africa Holdings (SSA) has been extended once again, pending approval by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. In January, the parties entered into an $8-million agreement, comprising a $4-million long-term loan and a $4-million payment for 49.99% of Vast&rsquo;s principal Zimbabwean assets. The transaction was dependent on the approval of the assignment of 49.99% of Vast&#39;s loan account with Canape by April 7, which was later extended to May 19. However, the company noted that correspondence from and discussions with Canape&#39;s bankers in connection with the application for approval indicate that the necessary approval for the assignment will be forthcoming, and all efforts continue to achieve this as soon as possible.&nbsp; While the approval of the assignment remains outstanding, a formal extension to June 2 has been agreed by all parties. Vast CEO Roy Pitchford said the company remained confident that the transaction with SSA would be successfully concluded in the near term. &ldquo;Although this process has been subject to frustrating administrative delays, SSA has reconfirmed its intent to finalise the transaction and remains wholly supportive of Vast.&quot;
