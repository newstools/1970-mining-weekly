ANKARA &ndash; Gold imports to Turkey rose to 48 t in May, up from 23.9 t in April, and marking the highest monthly imports since August 2008, data from the Istanbul bourse showed on Wednesday. Turkey&#39;s gold imports rose 17-fold in March, as Turks looked to hedge currency risk ahead of an April 16 referendum, followed by President Tayyip Erdogan&#39;s earlier calls to buy gold instead of dollars.
