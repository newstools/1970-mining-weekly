WELKOM &ndash; The search for the bodies of more illegal miners is continuing at Harmony Gold&rsquo;s Eland mine in Welkom, Free State, after a gas explosion on Thursday last week. Major General Lerato Molale said on Thursday that police believed there were more miners underground. &quot;The 11 miners that were arrested on Wednesday told us that more illegal miners were trapped underground,&quot; Molale said. The miners had forced their way into the St Helena shaft before the explosion. Eleven bodies were retrieved on Monday, 13 on Tuesday, and one on Wednesday. &quot;The rescue team travelled a distance of about 20 km to 25 km from the St Helena to the Elands shaft to get the bodies out of the mine,&quot; said Molale. The bodies had already started to decompose. Some had name tags attached. The miners, aged between 30 and 35, were believed to be from Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Lesotho. &quot;All of the bodies recovered are those of illegal miners.&quot; Molale said he was on his way to the mine.
