JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash;&nbsp;West Africa-focused Kodal Minerals on Tuesday said a due diligence by its strategic investor and proposed offtake partner, Suay Chin International, to support potential further investment in the company of up to &pound;4.3-million, is now substantially complete. Meanwhile, drilling at Kodal&rsquo;s Bougouni lithium project, in Mali, continues with the objective of following up on the high-grade drill intersections returned at the&nbsp;Ngouanala&nbsp;prospect and to test the Sogola-Baoule, Boumou and Orchard prospects.&nbsp; These new prospects have returned high-grade rock chip samples and, following completion of trench sampling, were prioritised for drill testing. &ldquo;Our drilling at the Bougouni lithium project has continued to demonstrate wide zones of pegmatite rock containing abundant spodumene mineralisation. The drilling at the Boumou, Orchard and Sogola-Baoule prospects has yielded positive results and new zones of high-grade mineralisation. All samples have been submitted to the laboratory for analysis and we are eager to receive the results of this drilling,&rdquo; CEO Bernard Aylward said on Tuesday. The drilling has confirmed&nbsp;pegmatite intersections over a total strike length of 450 m and to a maximum vertical depth of about 175 m. It remains open along strike and at depth. &ldquo;The initial review of drilling at the&nbsp;Ngouanala&nbsp;prospect is also indicating significant strike extensions and depth continuity to the mineralisation. The current drilling at&nbsp;Ngouanala&nbsp;is planned to provide sufficient data to confirm mineralisation, define strike and depth extensions, as well as highlight areas of high-grade mineralisation for future drill definition.&rdquo;
