JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified miner Rio Tinto on Tuesday urged its shareholders to vote in favour of the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary Coal &amp; Allied Industries (C&amp;A) to Yancoal Australia, as opposed to electing the counter proposal from Glencore. In January, Rio Tinto reached a binding agreement for the sale of the wholly-owned Australian subsidiary C&amp;A to Yancoal for an initial $1.95-billion cash payment and $500-million in aggregate deferred cash payments, payable over five years. Earlier this month, Glencore offered to acquire the C&amp;A assets for $2.55-billion, comprising an initial $2.05-billion in cash and $500-million in deferred cash payments payable as annual instalments of $100-million over five years. The offer also included a coal price-linked royalty. However, having considered factors in both proposals, Rio Tinto was leaning towards the Yancoal proposal, owing to its agreement to accelerate all deferred payments and make a single payment of $2.45-billion, plus a coal price-linked royalty, to buy the C&amp;A assets. Additional information and confirmations regarding Yancoal&#39;s funding plans has further cemented Rio Tinto&rsquo;s decision, while confirmation that Yancoal will waive all the regulatory approvals that are conditions precedent to its ability to close has also contributed. &ldquo;The expectation that there will be a much faster completion timeframe under Yancoal&#39;s proposal is in the best interests of Rio Tinto shareholders, as it reduced uncertainty,&rdquo; Rio Tinto added.
