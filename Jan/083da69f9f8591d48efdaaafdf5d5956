JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Galileo Resources&rsquo; 34%-owned subsidiary Glenover Phosphate and an undisclosed major phosphate producer (MPP) have entered into an agreement to undertake a two-phase, pilot plant phosphate flotation study (PPFS). The positive outcomes of the study could lead to the possible development of the Glenover phosphate/rare phase earth project, in Limpopo, with the &ldquo;ultimate objective&rdquo; of the undertaking to develop the project or offload it, in whole or part, to the MPP. MPP plans to inject $300 000 into the first phase of the PPFS, namely the water and ore variability study, while deciding between Option A production of 16 t of phosphate concentrate and Option B production of 32 t of phosphate concentrate for the Phase 2 bench scale confirmation tests and pilot plant study and obtaining board approval. &ldquo;Galileo and its Glenover joint venture partner have been in discussions with various groups concerning the development of the project. The successful group has elected to start the development testwork, prior to entering into a formal agreement either for project purchase, in whole or part, or a supply agreement, subject to testwork performance,&rdquo; said Galileo CEO Colin Bird. Galileo has engaged a South Africa-based consulting group to execute a mining right application for the project concurrent with the PPFS. Rare earths from the tailings of any future phosphate processing of the ore by the MPP would be available for further beneficiation.
