PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mineral sands miner Iluka on Wednesday flagged an increase in its zircon reference price of $130/t, to $1 100/t, effective from July this year. The reference price is the benchmark against which a range of Iluka&rsquo;s zircon products are priced, with the miner telling shareholders that its weighted average received price could and does vary from this, reflecting specific customer arrangements, market channels, geographies and product mix. Iluka in April this year reported a 118.5% increase in revenues for the three months to March, as sales volumes increased, with revenues reaching A$218.5-million during the quarter.
