JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed coal miner Edenville Energy has signed a letter of intent (LoI) to initially supply just over 1 000 t/m of coal to a customer, from its Rukwa operations in Tanzania. The supply volumes could potentially rise to 7 000 t/m as the operation expands. The LoI is the first stage of completing a formal coal supply agreement prior to first deliveries, expected to start in July. &ldquo;Over 100 t of coal have already been shipped to them for trial purposes and we are confident that we can deliver a product that will fit their needs,&rdquo; said CEO Rufus Short. In addition, Edenville is working on several other agreements that would provide additional sales. Meanwhile, the miner said it was moving ahead with the establishment of the mining fleet at site with the purchase of critical path equipment and the engagement of a local Tanzanian contractor to supply support equipment and services. As part of this, the company has completed the purchase of two key machines &ndash; a Volvo EC300D excavator and a Volvo L120G loader &ndash; to carry out loading at the mine site. The excavator will be used to carry out in-pit mining, while the loader will predominantly manage the stockpile area.
