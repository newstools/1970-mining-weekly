LONDON &ndash; Two dazzling pink and blue pear-shaped diamonds are together expected to fetch close to $70-million when they go under the hammer next month. Sotheby&#39;s said the Apollo and Artemis stones are &quot;by far the most important pair of earrings ever offered at auction&quot;. They will be offered to buyers separately at the auction house&#39;s May 16 Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale in Geneva. The 14.54 ct Apollo Blue is an &quot;Internally Flawless Fancy Vivid Blue&quot; stone with an estimated price tag of $38-million to $50-million while the Artemis Pink, a 16 ct &quot;Fancy Intense Pink&quot; stone, is seen at around $12.5-million to $18-million. &quot;I am certain there hasn&#39;t been another pair of coloured diamonds of this size and importance ever put into auction - certainly the highest estimated pair of earrings ever to appear at auction,&quot; David Bennett, worldwide chairperson of Sotheby&#39;s International Jewellery Division, told Reuters. &quot;We are selling them separately because there may well be somebody who wants them as a pair but it&#39;s also possible somebody might want just one or the other separately.&quot; Last week, a 59.60-ct pink diamond sold for a record $71.2-million in Hong Kong.
