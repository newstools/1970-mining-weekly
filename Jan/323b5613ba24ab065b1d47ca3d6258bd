PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has launched an investigation into mining major Rio Tinto&rsquo;s dealings in Guinea, regarding an alleged $10.5-million payment to a consultant on the Simandou iron-ore project. A furor erupted in November 2016 after Rio revealed it had become aware of a string of emails from 2011 that referred to the payment of a consultant providing advisory services on the Simandou project. The fallout included the dismissal of energy and minerals chief Alan Davies and legal and regulatory affairs group executive Debra Valentine, while a decision on then-CEO Sam Walsh&rsquo;s performance-related pay has also been suspended for two years. The AFP said in a statement to Mining Weekly Online on Tuesday that it was &ldquo;actively engaging&rdquo; with Rio in the investigation, pointing out that it is also a member of the International Foreign Bribery Taskforce, working closely with domestic and international counterparts to investigate allegations of foreign bribery. &ldquo;As this is subject to an ongoing investigation, it is not appropriate for the AFP to provide any further comment at this time,&rdquo; the AFP said.
