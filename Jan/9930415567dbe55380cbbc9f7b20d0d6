JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Construction company Afrimat expects to start production at its Diro iron-ore operations, in the Northern Cape, by mid-year. Afrimat CEO Andries van Heerden said during a media briefing on Thursday that the company was now in the process of refurbishing the business. &ldquo;We have started commissioning the plant slowly,&rdquo; he noted. The company last year acquired a majority stake in Diro Iron Ore and Diro Manganese&rsquo;s distressed assets for R276-million, after it was placed under business rescue. With the operation&rsquo;s one-million-tonne-a-year capacity, Van Heerden said the mine held &ldquo;excellent potential&rdquo; for growth, as it diversified the company&rsquo;s portfolio and provided a wider currency exposure and rand hedge. &ldquo;The margin that we expect to make on 1 t of iron-ore is more than the total sales price of 1 t of aggregate,&rdquo; he said, alluding to the company&rsquo;s main stream of income. Van Heerden said the company was now eyeing both the export and domestic market to sell its iron-ore, but heeded that the domestic market was still &ldquo;not very&rdquo; robust. &ldquo;However, it is much better than a year ago. Given our low-cost operating model, we believe we can actually make significant margin,&rdquo; he noted. With the iron-ore price currently trading at $59.75/t, it left the company in good stead. &ldquo;Any price north of $45/t, we can survive on, and at over $50/t, we will make good returns,&rdquo; said Van Heerden. &ldquo;We are also working on expanding our resource base and expanding our capacity to start producing higher volumes,&rdquo; he pointed out. The mine has a proven iron-ore reserve of 5.6-million tonnes, along with 1.3-million tonnes of saleable fine ore stockpiles.
