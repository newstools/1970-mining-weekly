BEIJING &ndash; China will speed up the closure of small-scale coal mines and strengthen inspections on safer production over the next three years, a government plan released on Monday showed. Beijing will accelerate closing small-scale coal mines with an annual production capacity of 90 000 t or less, as part of its plan to improve mine safety, according to the 13th five-year plan on the production safety of coal mines, jointly issued by China&#39;s State Administration of Work Safety and State Administration of Coal Mine Safety. China will reduce the death toll in coal mine accidents by more than 15% by 2020, according to the plan. Major coal mines accidents will be effectively controlled by 2020, the document said. There were 9 598 coal mines in China at end-2015 and 45.5% of them were small-scale. With poor safety conditions and equipment, most of the mines were vulnerable to disasters, the document said. A series of accidents have occurred in the past at coal mines in major production hubs in China, causing fatalities. China&#39;s coal output rose to 3.75-billion tonnes in 2015, from 3.24-billion tonnes in 2010. The death toll from coal mine accidents dropped 75.4% to 598 during the same five-year period, according to the document.
