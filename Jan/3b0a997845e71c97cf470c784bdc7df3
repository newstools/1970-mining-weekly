JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Sibanye on Wednesday reported that it had successfully completed an international corporate bond offering, which was about two times oversubscribed and raised $1.05-billion. The bonds comprise two tranches &ndash; a $500-million five-year note, carrying a 6.125% coupon and a $550-million eight-year note, carrying a 7.125% coupon. The proceeds of the bond offering, which will settle on June 27, will be applied to the partial repayment of the bridge loan raised for the acquisition of US-based Stillwater Mining Company (SMC). &ldquo;The significant interest in and support of Sibanye&rsquo;s first corporate bond issuance is heartening. The support from global investors . . . is a significant vote of confidence in the future prospects of Sibanye,&rdquo; CEO Neal Froneman enthused. Sibanye earlier this month also successfully concluded a $1-billion rights issue to help fund the $2.2-billion SMC acquisition. SMC provides Sibanye with a mine-to-market platinum group metals (PGMs) business in the US that has a metallurgical processing plant, a PGMs recycling operation and the near-term Blitz growth project that is expected to produce 270 000 oz to 330 000 oz of two-element PGMs by 2021/22.
