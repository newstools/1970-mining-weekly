VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Just two months into commercial production, Mountain Province Diamonds on Thursday announced the discovery of two large gem-quality stones 84.65 ct and 53.90 carats in size. The gems were recovered in April from the Gahcho Ku&eacute; mine, a 51%/49% joint venture between De Beers Group and Mountain Province, located some 280 km northeast of Yellowknife, in the Northwestern Territories. Each month, the partners bid for the fancy coloured and 10.8-carat-plus diamonds, and Mountain Province won the bid in April, including the exceptional gems. The stones will be included in the company&rsquo;s upcoming sales in Antwerp, Belgium. The 84.65-ct diamond is the largest gem quality diamond recovered to date and provides further confirmation that Gahcho Ku&eacute; hosts a population of large, high-quality gem diamonds. The 53.90-ct diamond is the highest-quality exceptional stone recovered to date and is expected to achieve a record price at tender,&rdquo; Mountain Province president and CEO Patrick Evans commented. The company said project operator De Beers plans to provide an updated life-of-mine plan for Gahcho Ku&eacute;, along with an updated financial model, further diamond pricing analysis and a fluorescence evaluation to be prepared by an external consultant before the end of August. Mountain Province also announced that the JV partners has approved a $19-million budget for winterisation of the conveyor systems and to install expanded dust mitigation systems at Gahcho Ku&eacute;. Installation of the new systems is scheduled to start in the second half of 2017,&nbsp; with completion expected in the first quarter of 2018. These new systems are expected to reduce unscheduled extreme cold weather downtime and also increase equipment and operational efficiencies.
