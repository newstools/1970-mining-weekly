RIO DE JANEIRO &ndash; Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Sider&uacute;rgica Nacional has resumed iron-ore exports using an alternate port while trying to repair damaged equipment in its Itagua&iacute; port, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. CSN, as the company is known, is temporarily using the Sudeste port, owned by Mubadala Development Co PJSC, the source added, without saying exactly when CSN resumed exports. Additional costs incurred in using the alternate port and repairs of damaged equipment are being paid by insurance policies, the source added. An accident on April 15 interrupted CSN&#39;s iron-ore exports. Analysts at Grupo BTG Pactual estimate iron ore sales generate about half of CSN&#39;s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, a gauge of operational profitability known as EBITDA. The company intends to resume the exports via its Itagua&iacute; port by May, the source added. CSN did not immediately comment.
