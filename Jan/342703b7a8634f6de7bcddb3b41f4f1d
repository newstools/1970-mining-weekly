VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Canadian junior Santacruz Silver Mining has signed an option agreement with certain private Mexican companies known as Contracu&ntilde;a under which Santacruz aquired an option to buy a 100% interest in the Veta Grande and Minillas properties, for $15.5-million, the company announced on Wednesday. The TSX-V-listed company currently operates the properties on a 60%/40% net profits interest basis under an exclusive thirty-year right granted by Contracu&ntilde;a. Santacruz will make five scheduled payments over 48 months to consummate the deal. &quot;The Veta Grande and Minillas properties together with our Zacatecas properties represent one of the largest and most historically important land packages within the Zacatecas mining region, and we are very pleased to have this agreement in place which gives us the opportunity to consolidate our mineral interests in the area,&quot; stated Santacruz president and CEO Arturo Pr&eacute;stamo. &quot;This is another important step in our plan to expand our Zacatecas operations into a larger district play, and we look forward to its continued development as part of Santacruz&#39;s transition into a mid-tier Mexican silver producer.&quot; Earlier this week, Santacruz announced that it has discovered a new mineralised vein crosscutting the Membrillo silver/zinc/lead/gold vein structure, located about 4 km from the company&#39;s Rosario mill located near Charcas, San Luis Potosi, in Mexico.
