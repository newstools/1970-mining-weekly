JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Sula Iron &amp; Gold has seen a smooth ramp-up into Phase 3 of its 5 000 m drill programme at its Ferensola gold project, in Sierra Leone, with both rigs drilling day and night shifts at the Sanama Hill deposit. The first hole drilled on Sanama Hill is complete and is being logged while two further holes on Sanama Hill are close to completion. The Phase 3 drilling programme is focused on improving the confidence in the geological interpretation and supporting a more accurate determination of the contained gold at Sanama Hill, as well as further outlining the potential of the southern target, where the three holes drilled have all returned gold mineralisation.
