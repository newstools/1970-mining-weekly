VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Precious gem miner Lucapa Diamonds has published a maiden Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource estimate for the Mothae kimberlite pipe, in Lesotho. ASX-listed Lucapa&#39;s Mothae project is located about 5 km from Gem Diamonds&rsquo; Let&scaron;eng mine. The resource estimate, prepared by the Johannesburg-based consulting company, MSA Group, reported an indicated and inferred resource of 38.96-million tonnes at an average grade of 2.7 carats per hundred tonnes (cpht), containing a total of 1.04-million carats to a depth of 300 m. MSA has modelled the Mothae kimberlite to a total depth of 500 m below surface, corresponding to a total estimated 77.4-million tonnes. The indicated resources amount to 2.39-million tonnes at an average grade of 3 cpht with the balance of 36.57-million tonnes at a grade of 2.7 cpht classified as inferred. The resource estimate assigns an average value of $1 063/ct, which the company ascribes to the presence of high value Type IIa diamonds.
