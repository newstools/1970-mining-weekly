JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Sweden-based iron-ore miner LKAB has contracted automation company ABB to modernise five mine hoists at its Kiruna mine. The order includes mechanical, electrical and automation equipment for hoists B2, B4, B5, B6 and B8. &nbsp; The miner was also modernising its central (CA) hoisting plant, which comprises eight hoists (B1 to B8) in the CA plant and five hoists in the subvertical level. ABB had recently secured orders to deliver a new B1 hoist and to modernise the B3 hoist, and has supplied equipment for all 13 production hoists over the years. The main artery of LKAB&#39;s production flow, the CA plant raises ore from the sublevel at 898 m up to ground level. ABB&rsquo;s delivery includes mechanical equipment for the hoist plants and shafts, electrical and control equipment, construction, electrical installation, installation supervision, site management and commissioning. The modernisation project is scheduled to start in 2018, and continue through 2024.
