PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed copper/gold miner Sandfire Resources has awarded an A$8.2-million civils and earthworks contract for the A$90-million Monty mine to the Yagahong Alliance. The alliance is a joint venture (JV) between Geraldton-based contractor Central Earthmoving and the Yugunga-Nya People, the traditional owners of the project areas. The civils and earthmoving contract encompasses the development of a 14-km-long haul road from the Monty operation to the DeGrussa copper/gold mine, local access roads, stockpile and laydown area pads, the cutting of a box-cut for underground access and additional infrastructure works and drainage. Site work is expected to start immediately. Sandfire MD and CEO Karl Simich said on Tuesday that the award of the first major contract for the Monty project was a great opportunity to extend the working relationship between Sandfire and the Yugunga-Nya people, through the Yagahong Alliance. Monty, which is a JV between Sandfire and Talisman Mining, could deliver about 70 000 t of copper, 21 000 oz of gold and 288 000 oz of silver over a three-year period.
