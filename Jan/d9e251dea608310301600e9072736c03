JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mining giant Rio Tinto, through its Rio Tinto Exploration subsidiary, has elected to proceed to the second stage of a farm-in agreement for ASX-listed Antipa&rsquo;s Citadel project, in Western Australia. The second stage of the farm-in will see the miner invest $8-million of exploration expenditure in the next three years, to earn a 51% joint venture interest in the project. Rio Tinto has already invested $3-million in the first stage of the farm-in agreement. The Citadel project hosts the Calibre gold/copper/silver/tungsten deposit and the Magnum gold/copper/silver deposit with combined mineral resources of 1.2-million ounces of gold, 139 000 t of copper and 1.4-million ounces of silver. Rio Tinto has also elected to become operator of the project, with further stages of the agreement including ongoing investment by Rio Tinto of up to a total of $60-million for a 75% interest. &ldquo;The decision by Rio Tinto to proceed with the agreement is a ringing endorsement of Citadel&rsquo;s quality and its exploration upside in the Paterson province,&rdquo; said Antipa MD Roger Mason. He added that Rio Tinto&rsquo;s commitment to take over the operations would bring valuable technical expertise and insights to the project, providing further endorsement of Antipa&rsquo;s exploration achievements.
