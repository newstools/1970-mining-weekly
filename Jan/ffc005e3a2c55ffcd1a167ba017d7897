VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-V-listed explorer Advantage Lithium on Wednesday announced results from the fourth hole drilled on the Clayton NE project, in the Clayton Valley of Nevada, reporting the highest-yet results obtained through drilling to date. Bordering the Silver Peak mine that is operated by Albemarle and is North America&rsquo;s only producing lithium mine, Hole CNE-17-04 on Clayton NE was drilled to a depth of 609.6 m, and intersected multiple aquifer formations, including a total composite of 426.72 m of brine-producing strata averaging 243.44 mg/ lithium between a depth of 140.21 m to 609.6 m, including a higher-grade interval averaging 274.6 mg/ lithium over 79.2 m, from a depth of 530.35 m to 609.6 m. The hole, part of a second phase of exploration drilling on the property, extended the mineralised brine trend to 4.46 km, building on the successful Phase 1 programme that defined a 3.43 km mineralised trend. Importantly, Advantage is drilling deeper into potentially untested aquifers. A previous hole, CNE-16-03, from the Phase 1 programme, was one of the deepest boreholes drilled in the Clayton Valley and, based on results obtained, may have hit a previously untested aquifer. &ldquo;These latest results are in line with our previous best hole at the project and, once again, we&rsquo;ve not only encountered lithium brines relatively close to surface but also at greater depths, which suggests we may have again hit previously untested aquifers. All-in-all, we are making excellent progress towards an initial resource estimate at Clayton NE,&rdquo; Advantage technical adviser and director Ross McElroy stated. Advantage, which is earning a 70% stake in the property after funding C$3-million in exploration expenditures on a package of five lithium properties optioned from Nevada Sunrise Gold, has now obtained permits and waivers for future development of a lithium brine resource and wells. In November, it received waivers from the Nevada Division of Water Resources for five of the six permitted holes, which allows for reaming a borehole to a larger diameter well, pump testing, and flow rate determination to provide the necessary technical information for development of an initial lithium brine resource at Clayton NE.
