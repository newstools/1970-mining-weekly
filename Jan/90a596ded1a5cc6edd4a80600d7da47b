TSX- and NYSE MKT-listed Sandstorm, which provides upfront financing to gold mining companies that are looking for capital and, in return, receives the right to a percentage of the gold produced from a mine over the life of the mine, reported 12 700 oz of gold equivalent, up from the 12 500 oz of gold-equivalent sold reported in the comparable period of 2016. On the heels of closing its $175-million acquisition of Australian gold explorer Mariana Resources, giving it control of the Turkey-based Hot Maden project, Sandstorm also reported the latest results from two drill holes on the high-grade deposit.
