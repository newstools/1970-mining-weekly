PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A preliminary feasibility study (PFS) has confirmed that the Cinovec project, in the Czech Republic, can be developed into a low-cost lithium carbonate producer, ASX- and Aim-listed European Metals reported on Wednesday. At a capital cost of A$393-million, the project could deliver some 20 800 t/y of battery grade lithium carbonate, with a mine life of some 22 years. Around 1.7-million tonne a year of ore will be mined and crushed in the underground mine, prior to being stockpiled to feed the plant. The PFS estimated that the project will have a net present value of A$540-million post tax, and an internal rate of return of 21% post tax, with the net overall cost of production estimated at A$3 483/t lithium carbonate. &ldquo;The study highlights the potential for Cinovec to be the world&rsquo;s lowest-cost hard rock producer of lithium carbonate due to its unique geological and metallurgical characteristics,&rdquo; said European Metals MD Keith Coughlan. &ldquo;These results coupled with the macro outlook for the lithium industry, particularly in Europe, highlight the attractiveness of the project. As a result, we will move directly into a definitive feasibility study to accelerate the project towards development.&rdquo; The PFS is based on mining 34.5-million tonnes of material, all of which is classified as indicated mineral resource. The tonnage used in the PFS represented only 5.2% of the total mineral resource and 9.9% of the indicated mineral resource at the Cinovec project.
