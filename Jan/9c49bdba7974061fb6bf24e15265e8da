NEW DELHI &ndash; India should rein in its lofty coal output target as power demand is growing at a slower pace than expected, a government policy think-tank said, even as state monopoly Coal India Ltd (CIL) struggles to sell already-mined coal. A turnaround in India&#39;s coal sector, from crippling shortages three years ago to a surplus thanks to faster government clearances, is seen as a major success for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The production boost means Coal India (CIL), the world&#39;s largest coal miner, is for the first time scouting for buyers abroad. But it is sticking to its plans to nearly double coal production to one-billion tonnes a year by the end of this decade. &quot;A careful assessment of demand for coal-based power is needed so that the over $1-billion annual investment being made by CIL in raising its production capability is not left stranded,&quot; the NITI Aayog said in its Draft National Energy Policy released late on Tuesday. Given that power demand was only growing at 5% a year at present, the coal sector should respond as needed, rather than pursue a &quot;target-led strategy&quot;, it said. Some experts say the weaker-than-expected power demand, though growing slightly faster than previous years, is also an indication of the softness in India&#39;s $2 trillion economy, whose growth in the January-March quarter unexpectedly slipped to its lowest in more than two years. NITI Aayog, or the policy panel, added that nearly 304-million Indians are still not connected to the grid, suggesting there was scope for demand to rise. The panel also proposed splitting Coal India&#39;s seven units into independent companies to improve efficiency through competition. It also called for more private participation in coal mining. &quot;The resulting competitive pressure will foster efficiency and bring about substantial reduction in coal prices,&quot; the panel said. &quot;It is entirely conceivable that our coal industry will emerge as an exporter of coal.&quot; Piyush Goyal, India&#39;s Power and Coal Minister, has repeatedly said Coal India will remain a single entity.
