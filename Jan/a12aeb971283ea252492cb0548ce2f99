PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold miner St Barbara has taken a 9.5% shareholding in fellow-listed Peel Mining, subscribing for 16-million ordinary shares, at a price of 20.5c each. Peel told shareholders on Tuesday that the A$3.3-million raised will allow for the acceleration of upcoming work programmes at the company&rsquo;s Wagga Tank volcanic massive sulphide prospect, in New South Wales. Peel noted that drilling is scheduled to start at Wagga Tank in April. &ldquo;We are pleased to welcome a company the calibre of St Barbara to our share register. St Barbara&rsquo;s funding commitment provides further validation of our strong belief in the mineral potential of the Cobar superbasin,&rdquo; said Peel MD Rob Tyson. He added that Peel will also be able to draw on St Barbara&rsquo;s experience in deep, underground mining, as the expertise gained from the Gwalia operation will be applicable to the Cobar-style deposits. St Barbara told shareholders that its investment in Peel was aligned with the company&rsquo;s strategy of targeted investments in early to advanced-stage exploration through earn-in arrangements, joint ventures or direct equity investment.
