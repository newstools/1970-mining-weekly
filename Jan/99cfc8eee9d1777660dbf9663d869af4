JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Basil Read Mining (BRM) will provide contract mining solutions to Botswana coal and energy development company Shumba Energy&rsquo;s coal projects. BRM specialises in contract openpit and opencast mining. Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by the parties, BRM will assist Shumba Energy by providing inputs for mine design, scheduling and mine planning, infrastructure development, operations and project management, surveying and optimisation. &quot;It has been our clear stated intent to select a few strategic operational partners to support our operational business model of using specialised outsourced services to execute our projects. This MoU is significant as it demonstrates the promised tactical execution of our plans and entry into a new phase of preparation for execution and, ultimately, the start of formal mining operations for thermal coal production and market entry,&quot; Shumba chairperson Alan Clegg said in a statement. Shumba controls a significant portion of advanced energy projects in Botswana, including over 4.5-billion tonnes of coal resources.
