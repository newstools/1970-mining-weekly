JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; JSE-listed Bauba on Friday announced that the Department of Water and Sanitation has granted a 20-year water-use license (WUL), effective March 30, for the farm Moeijelijk 412. This is an upgrade from the general authorisation for water use, which limited the extent of of Bauba&rsquo;s chrome mining operations at Moeijelijk. The WUL allows for additional water uses and enables Bauba to more readily conduct its opencast and underground chrome ore mining operations. &ldquo;The granting of this licence is the next important milestone in the development of our Moeijelijk chrome mine and will help ensure our underground production timeline and targets are achieved,&rdquo; said Bauba CEO Nick van der Hoven in an update to shareholders.
