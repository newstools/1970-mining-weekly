JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Given recent volatility in commodity prices and exchange rates, dual-listed Gold Fields has undertaken select hedging of the oil price and the Australian dollar gold price, the miner said on Tuesday. Gold Fields&rsquo; Australian dollar gold price hedge would comprise 165 000 oz at a floor price of A$1 695.86 and a cap of A$1 754.18 from June this year to December 2019; and 130 000 oz at an average forward price of A$1 719.92, between July and December this year. The gold volumes hedged represent 75% of the expected production from the Australia region for the second half of the year. The hedging activity is in line with Gold Fields&rsquo; policy to protect cash flow at a time of significant expenditure. &ldquo;The Australian dollar gold price hedge will protect the underlying cash flow of Gold Fields Australia, while we are funding the construction of the Gruyere gold project,&rdquo; the company noted. Meanwhile, the oil hedge comprises 78-million litres at an equivalent brent crude swap price of $49.92/bl between June this year and December 2019, in Australia, while in Ghana, the company hedged 126-million litres at an equivalent brent crude swap price of $49.80/bl for the same period. The volumes hedged represent 50% of the yearly fuel consumption for the two regions.
