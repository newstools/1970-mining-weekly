JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Australian miner Bass Metals on Monday reported that it expected to announce a maiden mineral resource at its Mahefedok deposit, at the Graphmada graphite mine, in Madagascar, during the current quarter. The company recently completed a 2 300 m drilling programme at the deposit, with significant intercepts of soft, easily mineable saprolite mineralisation, delivering intercepts of 24.4 m at 4.4% fixed carbon, 16 m at 5.1%, 13.2 m at 5.6% and 7.8 m at 6.6%. The miner noted that it would continue to invest capital to expand production to 6 000 t/y, through to 20 000 t/y of graphite concentrate sales by 2020. &ldquo;We will continue to materially grow our resource inventory, aggressively explore our permits and strategically assess potential acquisitions to meet growing demand in traditional and future technology markets,&rdquo; it said in a company strategy update. Bass Metals further noted that its Graphmada concentrates were the benchmark for foundries, crucible and refractory applications, owing to its &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; flake size, high resistance against oxidation, not containing carbonates such as calcite and dolomite, and having a low sulphur content.
