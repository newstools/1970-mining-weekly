JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed mining and bulk earthworks contractor Maca has mobilised its equipment and personnel to rare earths developer Northern Minerals&rsquo; Browns range pilot plant project, in Western Australia. Northern Minerals awarded the $6-million mining and bulk earthworks infrastructure contract to Maca in May, which would see the company mine around 180 000 t of ore and associated waste from the Wolverine and Gambit West. Waste material will be used to construct the tailings storage facility and other surface infrastructure. Maca will also prepare the pilot plant site, construct road access and construct the airstrip for the project. Mining will be undertaken in a single campaign, with ore stockpiled ahead of the three-year pilot plant phase. &ldquo;The site is now a hive of activity. With mining for the project to be completed as a single six-month campaign, we expect that the site will be significantly transformed over the short term, as we prepare for the arrival of the processing plant that Sinosteel MECC is currently constructing in China,&rdquo; said Northern Minerals MD and CEO George Bauk. In December last year, Northern Minerals signed a lead contractor agreement with Sinosteel MECC.
