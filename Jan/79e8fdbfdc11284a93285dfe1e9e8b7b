PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mineral sands developer Sheffield Resources has inked a cornerstone ilmenite offtake memorandum of understanding (MoU) over its Thunderbird mineral sands project, in Western Australia. The MoU with Chinese manufacturer CNNC Huayuan Titanium Dioxide Company covers some 45% of the estimated total volume of low temperature roast (LTR) ilmenite expected from Stage 1 of the Thunderbird project, and follows a succession of similar agreements executed for the zircon production from Thunderbird. Sheffield MD Bruce McFadzean said on Monday that the latest MoU confirmed Sheffield&rsquo;s high quality product capability when in production. &ldquo;The recently completed Thunderbird bankable feasibility study showed LTR ilmenite will generate 29% of the estimated project revenue. We look forward to concluding a binding offtake agreement with CNNC and establishing a long-term business relationship going forward.&rdquo; The A$271-million Stage 1 development is expected to have an 8.5-million-tonne-a-year throughput, doubling to 17-million tonnes a year in the fifth year of operations, with the investment of a further A$195-million. Over its 42-year mine life, Thunderbird is expected to deliver some 76 100 t/y of premium zircon, 68 500 t/y of zircon concentrate, 387 800 t/y of ilmenite and 229 800 t/y of titano-magnetite.
