TORONTO &ndash; Freeport-McMoRan, the world&#39;s largest publicly traded copper miner, is &quot;on a path&quot; to get a new mining deal with Indonesia this year for its giant Grasberg mine, CFO Kathleen Quirk said Thursday. The Arizona-based company resumed copper concentrate exports from Grasberg, the world&#39;s second biggest copper mine, in April after a 15-week outage related to a government dispute over mining rights. Freeport has been planning to ramp up production, which was cut by around two-thirds during the outage. The Indonesian government halted Freeport&#39;s copper concentrate exports in January, under new rules that require miners to adopt a special licence, pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51% stake in their operations and relinquish arbitration rights. Freeport, whose current contract runs until 2021 with two ten-year extensions, will only agree to a licence accompanied by an investment stability agreement that replicates current legal and fiscal certainty, Quirk said. &quot;We think we&#39;re on a path to be able to get that resolved during this year and that&#39;s our top priority,&quot; Quirk said via webcast from a Deutsche Bank conference.
