SYDNEY &ndash; Australian-Canadian miner OceanaGold said on Thursday that El Salvador has no legal basis for restricting its unit in the Central American country while it evaluates next steps in a dispute over extraction rights. El Salvador said this week that it had frozen OceanaGold&#39;s bank accounts and assets after the miner refused to pay the country $8-million as mandated by an international court. OceanaGold had sought $250-million from El Salvador over a revoked extraction permit but the World Bank&#39;s International Centre for Settlements of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled against the miner and ordered it to pay the nation&#39;s legal fees. &quot;The company is currently evaluating its next steps in-line with the ICSID tribunal allowed timelines,&quot; OceanaGold said in a statement. &quot;There are no legal grounds for restricting the El Salvador subsidiary company&#39;s activities during this period.&quot; The company reiterated that its El Dorado project, or any other opportunity in El Salvador, are not part of its business strategy right now. The Salvadoran Congress passed a law in March that prohibits any type of metal mining, part of a bid to protect the country&#39;s environment and natural resources.
