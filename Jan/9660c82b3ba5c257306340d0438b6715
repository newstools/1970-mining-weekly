PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The start of the Ichthys liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has been delayed by months, following delays in the installation of offshore production facilities. The 8.9-million-tonne-a-year project had initially been slated to start production in the third quarter of 2017; however, project developer Inpex has now moved this timeline back to before the end of the financial year, being March 2018. The company reported on Tuesday that the LNG project&rsquo;s central processing facility had set sail from its construction site in South Korea, and was expected to reach offshore Western Australia within the next month-and-a-half, after which shipyard commissioning and preparation work would be completed. The Ichthys floating production, storage and offloading facility is also scheduled to be towed to undergo hook-up. The Ichthys project has recently been hit by a number of set backs, including contract disputes between its contractors and claims from construction company Laing O&rsquo;Rourke that it had not been paid for work on the remote engineering project, prompting the company to withdraw some 600 workers.
