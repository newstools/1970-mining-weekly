PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association (Appea) has welcomed the establishment of the new Land Access Ombudsman in Queensland, after legislation was introduced to Parliament earlier this week. The government in December announced that the independent ombudsman would work with Queensland landholders and gas companies on coal seam gas (CSG) industry issues. The ombudsman is a central element of a revamp of the state&rsquo;s Gasfields Commission and CSG dispute resolution system. Appea Queensland director Rhys Turner said on Wednesday that the ombudsman would provide an alternative to court action should any disputes arise. He said while Appea would need to review the legislation in detail, industry supported the principle of an independent umpire to help resolve disputes. &ldquo;Queensland continues to show the way in ensuring that natural gas and agriculture work and succeed side-by-side,&rdquo; Turner said. &ldquo;The gas industry works with thousands of landholders and good working relationships are essential. We don&rsquo;t see evidence of widespread issues, but if there are any disputes industry and landholders need a balanced, timely, transparent, and accessible process to resolve them.&rdquo; In the past five years, more than 5 000 land access agreements have been successfully negotiated and more than A$238-million paid to landholders.
