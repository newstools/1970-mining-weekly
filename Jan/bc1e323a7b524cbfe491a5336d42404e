LUSAKA &ndash; Zambia is close to reaching an agreement with mining companies over its plans to increase electricity prices, Finance Minister Felix Mutati said on Wednesday. The government last month proposed introducing a flat tariff of $0.093/kWh backdated to January for mining companies, instead of individually negotiated rates that have averaged $0.06/kWh, but mining companies opposed the plan. A team headed by the minister of energy was due to hold talks with mining companies this week, including First Quantum Minerals. &quot;We have concluded with all the mining houses except for one. They have accepted our proposal to actually pay $0.093/kWh,&quot; Mutati told Reuters. However, an agreement has not yet been reached on backdating the higher tariffs to January as proposed by power firm Zesco, he said. &quot;It is part of the negotiations but ideally that is what the government is considering,&quot; Mutati said. Other mining companies operating in Zambia, Africa&#39;s No. 2 copper producer, include Glencore of Switzerland, Brazil&#39;s Vale and London-listed Vedanta Resources. Last week Zambia&#39;s Energy Regulation Board approved a 75% increase in the price of electricity for retail customers.
