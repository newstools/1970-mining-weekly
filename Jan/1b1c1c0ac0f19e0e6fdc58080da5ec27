JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A trenching programme at Aim-listed Armadale Capital&rsquo;s Mahenge Liandu graphite project, in Tanzania, has intersected high-grade, coarse-flake mineralisation over a width of 73 m. &nbsp; Three additional trenches are being excavated to support structural modelling of the deposit and prioritise higher-grade areas of mineralisation for drilling and bulk sampling. &ldquo;This, combined with the consistently encouraging test work returned from the project, which has shown that purity of up to 99.99% graphitic carbon can be achieved from graphite concentrates, reinforces our view that Mahenge Liandu has the potential to be a strategically important high-grade graphite mining operation,&rdquo; director Nick Johansen said in a statement on Wednesday. &nbsp; He added that the company&rsquo;s immediate focus was to continue the trenching programme, which would support the structural modelling of the deposit, and initiate the 2017 drilling campaign.
