PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Lithium producer Galaxy Resources has successfully completed its second spodumene concentrate cargo loading at the Port of Esperance, in Western Australia. The company has reported that 14 000 t of spodumene concentrate was shipped to customers in China on March 1. This is the second shipment for Galaxy and comes as the Mt Cattlin plant operations continue to ramp up and progress towards nameplate capacity. MD Anthony Tse on Thursday said the Mt Cattlin project was now moving into a stable operational phase, and that the steadier state of production, coupled with some key operational appointments, would allow for more focus on other development opportunities. Meanwhile, operations at Mt Cattlin will be focused on improving product quality, with a target specification of 6% lithium oxide, and a mica concentration closer to 1%. Galaxy is currently estimated to produce 160 000 t of lithium concentrate from its Mt Cattlin project, in Western Australia, during 2017.
