VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The board of the world&rsquo;s largest miner BHP Billiton has elected Ken MacKenzie to succeed Jac Nasser as chairperson. MacKenzie will assume the role of chairperson in September 1, following Nasser&rsquo;s retirement as both chairperson and a non-executive director. The appointment follows a formal succession process led by senior independent director Shriti Vadera. MacKenzie joined the BHP board as a non-executive director in September 2016 and is a member of the board&rsquo;s sustainability committee. He has extensive international business experience gained during his 23 years at Amcor, a global packaging company with operations in more than 40 countries. MacKenzie served as MD and CEO for 10 of those 23 years. Activist shareholder Elliott Management called on BHP on Wednesday to &quot;upgrade&quot; its board of directors as the mining giant prepares to select a new chairperson. Elliott, a New York-based fund that has built up a 4.1% stake in BHP, has maintained a barrage of criticism of the global miner since releasing a list of changes it wants at the company, including an exit from its US oil shale business. BHP&#39;s board of directors met in Chile, home to the company&#39;s massive copper mining business, where it selected a new chairperson.
