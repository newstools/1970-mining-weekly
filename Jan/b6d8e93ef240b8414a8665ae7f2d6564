PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Minerals explorer Argonaut Resources has won a 17-year battle to secure native title authority to undertake exploration at its Torrens project, in South Australia. The company on Monday reported that the South Australian Environment, Resources and Development Court had granted the company native title authority, after those opposing exploration at the site exhausted their means of opposition. Previous drilling at Torrens confirmed the existence of a major iron oxide-copper-gold mineralising system beneath sedimentary cover, but more drilling was required to intercept the modeled copper-gold mineralisation. The project is jointly held by Argonaut Resources and Aeris Resources, which holds a 70% interest in the project, with Argonaut acting as manager. The joint venture partners will now seek the reissue of two government approvals to finalise access provisions for a drilling programme at Torrens.
