PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Newly listed Todd River Resources has started an inaugural drilling programme at its Mount Hardy copper-zinc project, in the Northern Territory. Some 2 000 m of diamond and reverse circulation drilling will be done to test several geophysical targets, the company said on Friday. Drilling will continue until mid-May, before the rig is moved to the Walabanba project, where further high-priority targets have been scheduled for diamond drilling. The start of the drilling followed Todd River listing on the ASX earlier this week, and raising A$6-million through an initial public offering, following a demerger from fellow-listed TNG.
