JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Rio Tinto CEO Jean-S&eacute;bastien Jacques is confident China will continue to drive demand for mining products and iron-ore in particular, despite the introduction of new policies that will make environmental permits for steel mills harder to obtain and less capacity. The country plans to eliminate 100-million to 150-million tonnes of steel capacity to reduce the number of polluting steel furnaces and become more consumption-focused. Jacques believes the new policies will have a positive impact on China and the global mining industry in the medium to long term. &ldquo;The Chinese government is taking real action around pollution and the environment. We think this is the right thing to do and will have a positive impact on industry,&rdquo; Jacques noted in a copy of a speech delivered at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch &ndash; 2017 Global Metals &amp; Mining Conference in Barcelona, Spain. He added that the restructuring of the steel industry in China did not necessarily mean a reduction in output, noting that it could, in fact, increase demand for higher-grade iron-ore, as older, more polluting blast furnaces are taken off line. Further, he highlighted that, although China&rsquo;s growth rate had slowed, its economy remained healthy. &ldquo;We expect government stimulus to be sustained ahead of their senior leadership conference later this year. Even the early action to control credit will be helpful in the medium- and long term.&rdquo;
