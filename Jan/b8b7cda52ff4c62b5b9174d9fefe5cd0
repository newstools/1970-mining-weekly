JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The stronger rand is expected to have negatively impacted on Anglo American Platinum&rsquo;s (Amplats&rsquo;) headline earnings and headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months to June 30. Headline earnings are expected to be at least R329-million, or 126c a share, lower than in the six months to June 30, 2016. Restated headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R1.65-billion and 629c respectively. The miner further pointed out that its basic earnings and basic earnings per share (EPS) will also be at least R312-million, or 118c apiece, lower than the comparative period. Restated basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were R1.54-billion and 589c respectively. However, the company expected its results to even out, as the build-up of work-in-progress material of 65 000 oz, as a result of the rebuild of Waterval Furnace Number 1 in the fourth quarter of 2016, followed by the planned rebuild of Waterval Furnace Number 2 in the first quarter of this year, will result in more material being refined in the second half. Waterval Furnace Number 2 is already operating at steady state.
