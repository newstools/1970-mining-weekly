JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A recently completed scoping study on Aim-listed West African Minerals Corporation&rsquo;s (WAFM&rsquo;s) Cameroon-based Sanaga iron-ore project has identified two potential pathways to production of 2.4-million tonnes a year of premium grade iron-ore concentrate. The study indicates robust economics and favourable capital and operating cost fundamentals for an openpit iron-ore mine and concentrator, using transportation to the Cameroon coast either by barging down the Sanaga river and transshipping at sea or using a slurry pipeline to a port near Yoyo. The geometry of the mineralisation, which outcrops at surface, lends itself to low-cost, low-stripping ratio openpit mining,&rdquo; chairperson Gerard Holden said in a statement. Metallurgical testing on the primary magnetite ores indicates that the project can produce a high-quality iron-ore concentrate product that will command a premium price in the marketplace.&nbsp; The Sanaga project&#39;s proximity to the ocean and access to existing road and power infrastructure allows for low capital expenditures and a short timeframe to develop export infrastructure. &nbsp; &ldquo;These advantages are borne out by the robust project fundamentals and attractive economics demonstrated by the study.&rdquo; &nbsp; Holden added that Sanaga represents an opportunity to develop a low capital intensity project with a short pathway to cash flow. &ldquo;Ongoing feasibility work and engagement with regulators and stakeholders is planned as the next steps to advance the project,&quot; he said.
