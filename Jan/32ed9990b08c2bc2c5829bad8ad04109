PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Graphite developer Walkabout Resources has reported a proven and probable maiden ore reserve of five-million tonnes, grading 16.13% total graphitic carbon, for 809 081 t of graphite concentrate at its Lindi jumbo graphite project, in Tanzania. &ldquo;This reserve delivers the highest mill feed grade of all of the Tanzania graphite projects and provides the Lindi jumbo project with a huge technical and financial advantage over the other start-up graphite projects,&rdquo; said Walkabout executive director Allan Mulligan. A recently completed definitive feasibility study estimated that the Lindi project could deliver some 40 000 t/y of graphite concentrate over a mine life of 20 years, for a capital investment of $38.7-million. Walkabout is hoping to start construction at Lindi in the first quarter of 2018, provided that initial funding can be secured before the end of this month.
