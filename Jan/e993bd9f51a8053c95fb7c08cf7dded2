MELBOURNE &ndash; The world&rsquo;s biggest iron ore miners will be able to withstand the expected plunge in prices because their race to cut production costs has dramatically lowered the industry&rsquo;s margin pressure point, allowing them to keep fueling a cash juggernaut that&rsquo;s revived the mining sector. More than 90% of producers in the global seaborne market can generate profits at a benchmark price of $60 a metric ton, Adrian Doyle, a Sydney-based senior consultant at researcher CRU Group, said by phone. That compares with about 65% of suppliers able to avoid losses at the same price point three years ago, he said. &ldquo;There have been fantastic cost reductions in a lot of instances,&rdquo; while producers have also been boosted by lower oil prices, Doyle said. &ldquo;If we were thinking of a pressure point where we&rsquo;d start to see a bit of stretching in the industry, previously it would&rsquo;ve been around $60/t, now it&rsquo;s closer to $50/t-to-$45/t to stress test everyone but the majors.&rdquo; Benchmark iron ore dropped under $90 a metric ton last week for the first time since Feb. 10 amid rising supply in the 1.4 billion ton seaborne market and surging stockpiles in China. Ore with 62% content in Qingdao was at $86.72 a dry ton Friday, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. Prices rallied to $94.86/t on Feb. 21, the highest since August 2014. Futures in Dalian surged 4.3% to 684.5 yuan/t on Monday, the highest at close since March 3. Producers including BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group have warned prices are poised to retreat after they reported a surge in profits last month fueled by the price rally and their cost cuts. Perth-based Fortescue has more than halved cash costs in the past two years to about $12.54/t in the last quarter, while BHP lowered them by more than 25% to $15.05/t in the final six months of last year, according to filings. Prices are likely to move closer to $60/t by the end of this year, Sally Auld, chief economist and head of fixed-income and currency strategy for Australia at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., told Bloomberg TV in an interview. They will drop to $56.89/t in the final quarter of 2017, according to the median estimate among 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. About 14% of global producers lose cash at $60/t, according to Deutsche Bank analysts including Paul Young and Anna Mulholland. At $40, around 31% of the sector are loss-making, they wrote in a March 8 note. With prices at $90/t, only 1% of miners fail to generate profits. &ldquo;The fundamentals all point in the direction of a softening of that iron ore price,&rdquo; BHP&rsquo;s CFO Peter Beaven said Thursday at a Sydney conference. &ldquo;Supply continues to increase, particularly from Brazil,&rdquo; and there&rsquo;s a waning impact on demand from China&rsquo;s fiscal stimulus. The third-largest exporter is prepared for a &ldquo;much lower iron ore price.&rdquo; Brazil&rsquo;s Vale SA, the biggest exporter, is delivering its first cargoes to China from its $14-billion S11D mine and has cash costs that are likely to fall below $10/t, according to Australia&rsquo;s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. Rival producers including Rio Tinto Group, BHP, Fortescue and Roy Hill Holdings would all remain profitable at prices below $50/t, the department said in a report published in January.
