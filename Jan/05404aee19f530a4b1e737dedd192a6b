SYDNEY - Activist investor Elliott Management on Thursday said a meeting with BHP Billiton CEO Andrew Mackenzie in Barcelona had been &quot;constructive&quot;. The meeting on Wednesday took place a day after the New York-based fund raised the pressure for strategic changes at the mining giant, including a call for an independent review of its petroleum division. Elliott spokesman Michael O&#39;Looney said the fund, which controls 4.1% of the miner&#39;s London-listed shares, had a private meeting with Mackenzie. &quot;We found it was constructive,&quot; he said, declining to provide further details. It was the first time BHP had met with Elliott since the fund went public with a $46-billion overhaul proposal on April 10. A BHP spokeswoman declined to comment on Elliott&#39;s statement. Ross Barker, managing director of the Australian Foundation Investment Company, a top 10 holder of BHP&#39;s Australian shares, said it was appropriate that the company was meeting with Elliott to show it was listening to shareholder concerns. However, he said he was not convinced by Elliott&#39;s argument that now was the right time for BHP to divest petroleum assets. &quot;So far I think (BHP) make a convincing case to let them extract value as they have in other parts of the business,&quot; he said. &quot;To shorten that by going straight to the market now wouldn&#39;t necessarily be obviously the best course unless there was clearly a buyer that wanted to pay a lot more than the value that BHP think they can extract.&quot;
