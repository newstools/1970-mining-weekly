PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold miner Saracen Mineral Holdings has reported another strong quarter of production, with the miner delivering 65 130 oz of gold during the three months to March. The latest quarterly production was down slightly from the 66 222 oz delivered in the previous quarter, but Saracen said on Wednesday that the company was on track to meet its June quarter guidance of 80 000 oz, and achieve its targeted 300 000 oz/y rate. The Carosue Dam operation delivered 39 033 oz during the quarter under review, while the Thunderbox mine contributed 26 097 oz. Both mines are in Western Australia. &nbsp;All-in sustaining costs for the quarter were 7% above guidance, at A$1 510/oz, owing to the impact of rain on production. Meanwhile, gold sales for the quarter reached 68 471 oz, and at an average sales price of A$1 612/oz, generated a total revenue of A$110.4-million.
