PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Western Australia&rsquo;s miners will be hit with additional shipping fees of between 3c/t and 4c/t as part of the state government&rsquo;s efforts to plug revenue losses. Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said on Friday that port fees for the state&rsquo;s biggest companies would increase as part of the state&rsquo;s &#39;budget repair&#39; programme, and were expected to generate some A$95-million in revenues. However, junior miners using the Utah Point Bulk Handling Facility will be spared the brunt of the increases, with Saffioti saying the discount in port changes for junior miners would continue. &quot;This is a decision we have had to make to fix the Budget mess left behind by the Liberal National government. Everyone will share the burden to help pay for the Liberals and Nationals&#39; out of control spending. &ldquo;Fixing the mess we have inherited will take time, but we will do everything possible to minimise the impact. That&#39;s why we have extended the discount for junior miners, giving them confidence going forward,&rdquo; she added. The extension of the discount is intended to provide certainty to junior miners using the Utah facility in the current climate and will be applied to iron-ore exports from July 1. Fremantle port&#39;s fees and charges will increase by an average of 2.5%, the ports of Albany, Bunbury and Esperance will rise 0.5%, while the Port of Broome&#39;s fees increase by 2%.
