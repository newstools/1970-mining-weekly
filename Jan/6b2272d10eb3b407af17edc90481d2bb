VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior gold producer Rye Patch Gold has completed the first gold pour from the new leach pad at the refurbished Florida Canyon mine, in north-western Nevada. The Vancouver-headquartered project developer poured 485 oz of gold as dor&eacute; in April from the new south heap leach pad, with the first pour taking place on April 25. Residual leaching from the old Florida Canyon and Standard Gold mines produced a further 602 oz, the company reported on Monday. &quot;This is a significant milestone for Rye Patch Gold. The Florida Canyon team has done a phenomenal job on the re-start of the mine and we are excited to be Nevada&#39;s newest gold producer. We can now turn our sights to realising the tremendous potential of our other projects along the Oreana Trend and reaching our goal of becoming Nevada&#39;s next mid-tier producer,&quot; president and CEO William Howald stated. Rye Patch started irrigation of the newly built south heap leach pad in mid-April, nine months after acquiring the Florida Canyon mine in July 2016. The company plans to ramp up towards commercial production during the current quarter. According to Rye Patch&rsquo;s March 2016 preliminary economic assessment, Florida Canyon is expected to produce on average 75 000 oz for eight years at cash cost of $759/oz.
