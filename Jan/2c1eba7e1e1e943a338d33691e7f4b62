BEIJING - China&#39;s coking coal futures soared 8 percent on Thursday and were on track for their biggest one-day jump in seven months, boosted by a report the world&#39;s top consumer plans to ban imports into small ports, stirring worries about tightening supply. The most-active coking coal futures in early trade touched 1 134.5 yuan ($167.32), up 8% and their highest since May 3. Prices were at 1 119.5 yuan a tonne at 0330 GMT. Coke on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose more than 5% to its strongest in three months, with its intraday peak at 1 773.5 yuan. &quot;The price rallies on coking coal and coke are driven by the worries about a supply shortage in the future, which helps lift the whole bulk commodities market,&quot; said Xu Bo, analyst at Haitong Futures. China&#39;s state media reported on Wednesday that the country would ban coal imports at small ports from July 1, the latest move by the country to curb arrivals of foreign product. The relative strength index, a key technical indicator, showed that the coking coal and coke markets had broken above 70, suggesting they have been overbought.
