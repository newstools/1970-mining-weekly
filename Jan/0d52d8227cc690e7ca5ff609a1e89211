PERTH (miningweekly.com)- Junior Australian Mines has started construction on a A$2-million demonstration size cobalt-nickel-scandium processing plant for its Sconi and Flemington projects, in Queensland an New South Wales. Once operational, the plant will result in Australian Mines being one of the only emerging cobalt companies in Australia producing cobalt sulphate and nickel sulphate products for potential offtake customers from the vehicle batter and cobalt trading sectors, as well as producing scandium oxide destined for European auto-manufacturers. &ldquo;With the company&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with potential cobalt, nickel and scandium customers across Europe, Asia and the Middle East, it became apparent that the quickest path to progressing those negotiations was to go ahead and produce samples to reinforce certainty around expected product quality,&rdquo; said Australian Mines MD Ben Bell. With a 2 200 kg/d throughput capacity, the plant is expected to produce some 67 kg of cobalt sulphate, 500 kg of nickel sulphate and 8 kg of scandium oxide a week. The plant will be situated in Perth, and construction is estimated to take some six months, with first products scheduled for delivery in November.
