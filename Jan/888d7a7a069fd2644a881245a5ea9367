PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Coal miner New Hope Corporation has told shareholders that it would weigh its options to secure approval for the Stage 3 expansion of its New Acland mine, after the Queensland Land Court recommended that the mining lease and environmental authority not be granted. The New Acland Stage 3 project will expand the mine&rsquo;s yearly output from 4.8-million tonnes to 7.5-million tonnes and will extend the operation&rsquo;s life beyond the current end-date of 2017/18. The expanded operation will see a further 260 people employed at the mine, and could inject some A$12-billion in local, state and federal revenues over the life of the project. In citing its reasoning for recommending that the mining lease and environmental authority not be granted, the Land Court raised concerns about the impact of the proposed expansion on groundwater in the region. New Hope said on Wednesday that the livelihoods of some 782 employees and contractors depended on the continuation of the mine and the approval of the Stage 3 operation, which would provide employment stability for several more years. The company has maintained its commitment to delivering the New Acland Stage 3 project, saying it would actively progress the project through the final stages of approval. The federal government in January this year approved the A$900-million continuation project, and the Queensland Minister for Natural Resources and Mines and the chief executive of the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection will now have the final say on whether the project is approved.
