PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Oil and gas producer Woodside Energy has struck a long-term sales and purchase agreement with Indonesian oil and gas company PT Pertamina for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG), starting in 2019. Woodside said on Tuesday that the company had committed to ramp up supply to about 600 000 t/y of LNG from 2022 to 2023, with the option of increasing supply to about 1.1-million tonnes a year from 2024 to 2038. The LNG would be sourced from Woodside&rsquo;s global portfolio and would see the company becoming a significant supplier of LNG to Indonesia. &ldquo;Our track record as a reliable supplier of LNG and the proximity of our key sources of LNG to Indonesia were key to achieving this deal. As more regional buyers enter the market, we are well placed to become the supplier of choice,&rdquo; said Woodside CEO Peter Coleman.
