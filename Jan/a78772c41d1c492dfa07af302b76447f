JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold miner Acacia Mining paid $184-million in 2016 to the governments of countries where it operates. Of this, the Tanzanian government received $88.11-million in income tax and royalties. When payroll-related and other taxes are included, this figure amounts to $165-million. &ldquo;As the home to our three operating mines, Tanzania receives the majority of our contribution to governments and we invest around 80% of our revenues back into the country. &ldquo;However, over the past few years, we have also expanded our business beyond Tanzania, with active exploration programmes . . . taking place across Kenya, Burkina Faso and Mali,&rdquo; CFO Andrew Wray said in a report released on Friday. He added that, together with the increase in royalties and the other taxes it pays, the miner&rsquo;s contribution to Tanzania had increased by 39% year-on-year. Acacia and the Tanzanian government are currently in a dispute over back taxes. The Tanzanian government has accused the gold miner of failing to pay billions of dollars in taxes, after two Presidential committees determined that the company&nbsp; underdeclared its mineral exports. Acacia, however, believes the committees&nbsp; overstated the value of concentrates it had exported. Reuters on Thursday reported that the Tanzanian government&nbsp; submitted three new Bills to Parliament that would enable it to force mining and energy companies to renegotiate their contracts with&nbsp; government. This follows after one of the Presidential committees had called for an overhaul of the country&rsquo;s mining code.
