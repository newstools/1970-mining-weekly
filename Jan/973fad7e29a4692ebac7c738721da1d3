PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Queensland government has opened the draft terms of the environmental-impact assessment for the proposed Olive Downs coal project for public comment. &ldquo;This is the first step in a rigorous process for this mine proposal that could create more than 500 construction jobs a year over two years,&rdquo; said Queensland State Development Minister Dr Anthony Lynham. &ldquo;The Coordinator-General will consider all comments and release the final terms of reference for the environmental-impact statement, which the proponent will then be required to fully address.&rdquo; The A$1-billion Olive Downs mine, being developed by Pembroke Resources, is expected to produce up to 14-million tonnes a year of coal, over a mine life of more than 30 years. The proposed mine will be midway between Moranbah and Dysart and include an 18 km rail spur to the Norwich Park Branch railway, a water pipeline connecting to the Eungella pipeline network, an electricity transmission line and access roads. Pembroke is hoping to start production at Olive Downs in 2020. The draft terms of reference are available online and in local libraries, and submissions are open until May 12.
