TORONTO &ndash; Shanghai-listed Shandong Tyan Home said on Wednesday its negotiations with Barrick Gold to buy the Canadian operator&#39;s 50% stake in Kalgoorlie mine have ended without a deal, citing new capital and acquisition rules in China. Toronto-based Barrick had been reviewing the financial backing behind an approximate $1.3-billion bid for its stake in Kalgoorlie mine by Minjar Gold, a unit of Shandong Tyan, Reuters reported in November. Barrick, the world&#39;s largest gold producer, declined to comment on the matter. It reports first-quarter financial results on April 24. In February, Barrick president Kelvin Dushnisky said &quot;advanced negotiations with a proposed buyer,&quot; were under way and Barrick would be &quot;happy sellers&quot; at the right price. &quot;We&#39;re also very happy to continue to own that asset,&quot; he said. Shandong Tyan said it had been in contact with Barrick about buying a stake in the mine, but did not reach any formal investment agreement. &quot;We did not continue the negotiation,&quot; it said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Wednesday, due to China&#39;s capital outflow curbs and greater scrutiny of overseas acquisitions. Shandong had trumped offers by Australian, Chinese and Canadian companies for the asset, sources had told Reuters. Newmont Mining, Barrick&#39;s joint venture partner at Kalgoorlie and mine operator, has said it was interested in buying the remaining stake, but price has been a sticking a point. &quot;We would be open to discussing a possible transaction with Barrick on (Kalgoorlie) if they are interested in doing so,&quot; said Newmont spokesperson Omar Jabara. Shandong Tyan is a publicly-listed arm of Shandong Tianye Group, a private company with operations including property development, mining, finance and venture investment. It is unrelated to Shandong Gold Mining, a Shandong province state-owned enterprise, which recently struck a $960-million deal to buy a 50% stake of Barrick&#39;s Veladero gold mine, in Argentina. Under that deal, which was announced on April 6 and which confirmed an earlier Reuters report, the two miners will also look at jointly developing Barrick&#39;s nearby undeveloped Pascua-Lama gold and silver project and additional investment opportunities in the El Indio Gold Belt.
