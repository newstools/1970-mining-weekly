JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; An accelerated development of resources at Aim-listed Anglesey Mining&rsquo;s Parys Mountain zinc project, in north Wales, over a shorter mine life, will be economically more attractive. This is based on results from a continuing scoping study into the project, which is being undertaken by engineering firms Micon and Fairport. Anglesey has asked Micon and Fairport to consider alternative production and throughput scenarios at various levels between 500 t/d and 1 000 t/d. The initial approach adopted for the scoping study was a plan to mine these resources at 500 t/d, or 165 000 t/y, beginning with development of the mineral deposits closest to surface.&nbsp; This would result in a mine life of around 16 years, with mining of the indicated resources only and none of the inferred resources. Fairport has considered some processing alternatives, specifically the introduction of dense media separation, which is estimated to increase the effective daily production rate by about 40% with a limited increase in capital.&nbsp; &ldquo;On reviewing the current indicative levels of the capital cost of mill equipment, including readily available used processing plant, it was felt that construction of a larger processing plant with a higher throughput rate could be justified,&rdquo; the company said in a statement on Friday. This would require additional mine development, a higher capital cost and result in a shortened mine life based only on the existing 2.1-million tonnes of indicated resources, but will generate an enhanced financial outcome.
