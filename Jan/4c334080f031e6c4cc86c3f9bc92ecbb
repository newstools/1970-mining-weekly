VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Quebec-based project reviver Champion Iron has attained another milestone in its endeavours to restart mining at the high-grade Bloom Lake iron mine, after its subsidiary reached agreement with the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway Company (QNS&amp;L) to transport iron-ore. The agreement provides that iron-ore concentrate from Quebec Iron Ore&rsquo;s (QIO&rsquo;s) Bloom Lake property will be carried about 400 km on the QNS&amp;L railway from the Wabush Lake junction, in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador, to the Sept-Iles junction in Sept-&Icirc;les, in Quebec. &ldquo;This agreement will ensure long-term access to some of the world&rsquo;s largest consumers of iron-ore for our future high-quality product. The signing of this rail transport agreement also marks yet another significant milestone in the Bloom Lake restart,&rdquo; chairperson and CEO Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe stated on Tuesday. ASX- and TSX-listed Champion acquired the Bloom Lake assets in April last year from Canadian affiliates of US iron-ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources that were subject to bankruptcy proceedings under the Companies&rsquo; Creditors Arrangement Act. Champion holds 63.2% of QIO, with the remaining 36.8% equity interest owned by Ressources Quebec, acting as a mandatory of the Quebec provincial government.
