PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed junior Artemis Resources has completed the acquisition of the Radio Hill nickel/copper/cobalt project, in Western Australia, along with $2-million of overseas institutional funding. In order to fund the Radio Hill acquisition, Artemis entered into a $2-million funding agreement by way of the issue of convertible securities with an aggregate face value of $2-million with a consortium of investors. The loan agreement has a maturity date of 16 months, and has a commitment and implementation fee of 9%, while the convertible securities have a fixed conversion price of 12c per fully paid ordinary share, subject to certain conditions. Artemis acquired the Radio Hill project from Fox Resources for A$2-million in cash and the issue of 20-million Artemis shares. An independent review revealed in April that the project would require some A$4.6-million to refurbish to operational readiness. The asset includes the 425 000 t/y Radio nickel and copper processing plant, a tailings storage facility, administration and maintenance buildings and a fully developed underground mine, which was placed on care and maintenance in 2008. The project has a nickel/copper resource of 4.02-million tonnes, grading 0.51% nickel and 0.88% copper, with significant exploration upside potential. &ldquo;For the first time in the Karratha region, we now have a company that controls a large tenement package around a &#39;hub and spoke&#39; play with the key Radio Hill multi-metals metallurgical process plant being at the centre of a number of growing cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and gold deposits,&rdquo; said Artemis executive chairperson David Lenigas on Friday. &ldquo;It should also add significant value to the potential development of our new Carlow Castle cobalt discovery. In addition, this acquisition brings to book some exciting iron-ore deposits and a large quarry inventory at the Radio Hill mine site that can contribute considerably to the new road and mining infrastructure being planned for the Karratha region.&rdquo;
