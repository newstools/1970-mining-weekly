VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Base metals miner Taseko Mines has completed an offering of $250-million principal amount of 8.75% senior secured notes due 2022, which it used with a portion of its existing cash balance, to fund the redemption of its senior notes due 2019 and to repay its senior secured credit facility and the related copper call option. &quot;Our balance sheet is much stronger today and provides the company with the security and flexibility to manage our operations at Gibraltar and continue to advance our pipeline of projects,&rdquo; president and CEO Russell Hallbauer said. &ldquo;We felt it was prudent to use a portion of our growing cash balance, from a strong operating performance and the recent silver stream sale, to reduce our overall long-term debt.&quot; The company used the $247.5-million in proceeds from the notes offering and $54.5-million of cash to fund the redemption of its outstanding senior notes due 2019 for $203.8-million including accrued interest, to repay its senior secured credit facility for $79.4-million including accrued interest, to buy out a copper call option held by the credit facility lender for $11.9-million and for estimated transaction costs of $6.9-million.
