VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Andrey Polyakov will resign as president of the World Diamond Council (WDC) by the end of the week. VP Stephane Fischler will serve as acting president from July 1 until May 1, 2018, when he will start his two-year term as WDC president.&nbsp; The New York-based WDC did not state the reason for the sudden departure. The WDC is an industry group focused on removing conflict diamonds from the global supply chain and protecting the value of natural diamonds. The WDC is the voice of the international diamond industry in a tripartite collaboration with governments and civil society known as the Kimberley Process (KP). The KP secures and manages monitoring processes that have virtually eliminated the trade in conflict diamonds to ensure that the world&rsquo;s supply of diamonds is from sources free of conflict.
