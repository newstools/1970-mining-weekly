VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Base metals producer Nevsun Resources has once more sold copper concentrate produced from primary ore at the Bisha mine, in Eritrea. The Vancouver-based miner reported on Tuesday that it has sold and shipped 5 800 t of concentrate to an international trader on competitive commercial terms. The company, which last month appointed Peter Kukielski as its new president and CEO, is scheduled to load further shipments at the Port of Massawa in the coming weeks. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Nevsun reported that Bisha was only able to produce a bulk concentrate in the copper circuit and was unable to consistently produce a saleable copper concentrate as it mined through boundary ore in the openpit. During the quarter ended March 31, Bisha has achieved improvements in production of its desired zinc and copper concentrates. It explained that owing to several changes being implemented at the Bisha mine, the company has been able to reduce the activation of zinc sphalerite ore in the copper circuit, which resulted in the production of meaningful quantities of copper concentrate during February and March. The improved separation is also leading to increased amounts of zinc concentrate being produced in the zinc circuit, with less bulk concentrate output. Nevsun continues to dedicate significant resources, including the use of external specialists, to increase the recoveries of copper and zinc in their respective circuits towards design levels, and to upgrade the quality of the copper and zinc concentrates produced to improve marketability. Nevsun is forecasting output of 10-million to 20-million pounds of copper and 200-million to 230-million pounds of zinc concentrate in 2017, with all the zinc concentrate slated for sale at spot prices to capture price growth and low treatment charges.
