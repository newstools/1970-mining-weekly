JSE-listed Keaton Energy delivered &ldquo;pleasing&rdquo; production volumes for the financial year ended March 31, despite experiencing a 4% dip in sales. Some 2.1-million tonnes of washed two- and four-seam thermal coal from Keaton&rsquo;s Vanggatfontein openpit colliery, near Delmas, was sold to State-owned power utility Eskom during the period under review, a 4% decline on the sales of 2.2-million tonnes in the prior year. Keaton also reported 35 961 t of five-seam metallurgical coal sales in the 2017 financial year, down from 98 252 t in 2016, reflecting the decision to use the plant for toll washing, where a total of 206 334 t was toll washed, compared with zero in the prior year. &ldquo;Although production was slightly off record levels owing to the extremely wet weather during the last quarter, it was a pleasing result,&rdquo; Keaton CEO Mandi Glad said in a statement on Thursday.
