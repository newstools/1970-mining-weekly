VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Brazil-focused project developer Belo Sun Mining reported on Thursday that the Agrarian Court of Altamira has lifted the temporary injunction related to the construction licence (LI) for the Volta Grande gold project. The court in February issued a temporary 180-day injunction halting certain work related to the LI to provide time for the relocation of certain families living in an area in proximity to the Volta Grande project. The TSX-listed company said it will continue to work with the communities in the Volta Grande project&#39;s area of influence, as well as all governmental agencies and the courts, to ensure that all requirements and obligations are met. The company added that it continues to work &ldquo;diligently&rdquo; towards resolving the second suspension order against the LI related to the indigenous study, which it hopes will be positively resolved in a &ldquo;timely manner&rdquo;. The Brazilian Federal Regional Court in April issued an interim suspension order halting construction of the flagship Volta Grande project pending completion of an indigenous study.
