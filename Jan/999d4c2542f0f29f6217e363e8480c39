JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Swedish mineral exploration and development company Beowulf has completed four diamond drill holes at its Aitolampi graphite prospect, in Finland. About 505 m have been drilled in total, with drill holes extended 350 m along strike for the main conductive zone. &quot;We are making excellent progress with the graphite drilling at Aitolampi and, having completed approximately 505 m out of a 1 300 m drilling programme, we are encouraged by the results,&rdquo; CEO Kurt Budge said.&nbsp; He added that the company has seen significant lengths of graphite in all holes drilled to date, in the areas where it had previously identified electromagnetic conductors. &quot;Drilling should be completed shortly and, with sample deliveries to ALS Minerals, in Outokumpu, having already commenced, we look forward to reporting the assay results in April.&rdquo; Substantial widths of graphite mineralisation, up to 100 m down-hole width, have been intersected, which correspond with identified electromagnetic conductors. Composite samples are also being prepared, which will be sent to an accredited laboratory, for metallurgical testwork, after drilling is completed. &quot;All this work will further support our assessment of a potential resource and the commercial prospects of the graphite that we are finding.&quot;
