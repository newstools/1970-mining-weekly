JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A scoping study on Aim-listed Anglesey Mining&rsquo;s Parys Mountain copper-lead-zinc project, in North Wales, is nearing completion, with the results of the study to be published later this month. Earlier this year, the company said the scoping study was being modified by Micon International and Fairport Engineering to examine increased throughput alternatives at 700 t/d and 1 000 t/d, compared with the 500 t/d used initially. A 2012 Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code-compliant resource estimate compiled by Micon included a resource of 2.1-million tonnes at 6.9% combined base metals in the indicated category and 4.1-million tonnes at 5% combined base metals in the inferred category. Anglesey expected the inputs from the new phase would be incorporated into updated financial models and, based on preliminary reviews, improved inputs to the financial model, including reduced operating costs and increased yearly production, are likely to be achieved. &ldquo;It was previously expected that an increased yearly production rate would result in a significant increase in capital costs and, while we expect some increase in capital costs, it is likely to be less than previously expected and together with the production and operating cost adjustments should justify the increased production approach,&rdquo; the miner noted.
