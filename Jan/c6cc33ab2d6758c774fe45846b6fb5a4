PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The expected capital costs for the Pilgangoora lithium/tantalum project, being developed by ASX-listed Pilbara Minerals, have increased by A$10-million following amendments to the scope of the processing plant. The lithium developer said on Friday that the Pilgangoora project would cost some A$234-million to develop, compared with the original capital cost of A$224-million. The company has continued to optimise the process design and operating parameters of the Pilgangoora plant since completing the project definitive feasibility study last year, through metallurgical testwork and pilot-scale process programmes of the heavy media separation, gravity and flotation circuits. The work has resulted in operating cost savings of more than A$2.50/t. &ldquo;The investment we have made in feasibility studies, testwork programmes and amassing technical skills to support Pilgangoora&rsquo;s development runs well beyond that of comparable projects,&rdquo; said MD Ken Brinsden. &ldquo;Results from ongoing testwork programmes further demonstrate the quality of Pilangoora spodumene and its capacity to deliver high-grade, low-cost products for the market. That&rsquo;s why we have attracted premium customers in the form of General Lithium and Ganfeng. The Pilgangoora project is expected to produce an average of 314 000 t/y of 6% spodumene concentrate and 321 000 lb/y of tantalite, over a mine life of 36 years. The project is estimated to have a post-tax net present value of A$709-million and an internal rate of return of 38.1%, and is expected to generate life-of-mine revenues of A$9.23-billion.
