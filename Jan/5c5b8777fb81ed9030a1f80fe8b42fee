PERTH (miningweekly.com)- ASX-listed junior Artemis Resources has inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with Blackrock Metals to undertake a scoping study on the Mt Clement-Paulsens gold and silver project, in Western Australia. The two companies would fund the study on a 50:50 basis, with Artemis telling shareholders on Thursday that the study was targeted for completion in September, allowing for the Mt Clement-Paulsens project to move into production as soon as practicable. On completion of the study, Artemis and Blackrock will proceed with a formal JV to jointly fund and develop the project. &ldquo;It&#39;s time to look at putting Artemis&rsquo;s Mt Clement-Paulsens gold and silver project into production,&rdquo; said chairperson David Lenigas. &ldquo;There is a significant resource of gold and silver already identified and this project has an excellent chance of being developed as an openpit heap/vat leach project using Merrill Crowe for final metal recovery to capture not only the gold but also the high levels of silver in the rock.&rdquo; The Mt Clement-Paulsens project is currently estimated to host an inferred mineral resource of some one-million tonnes, grading 1.7 g/t gold and 17 g/t silver for 64 400 oz of contained gold and 618 500 oz of silver.
