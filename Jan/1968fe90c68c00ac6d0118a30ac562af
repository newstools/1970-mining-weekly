BAMAKO &ndash; Australia&#39;s Resolute Mining will start producing gold from a three-million-ounce underground deposit at its Syama gold mine next year, its CEO told Reuters. In an interview while visiting Mali&#39;s capital Bamako this weekend, Resolute Mining CEO John Welborn also said a recently discovered adjacent deposit called Nafolo was expected to yield between 1.5-million and 2-million ounces of recoverable gold reserves. The Syama gold mine had already produced around 2-million ounces from open pit mining at its surface before it was exhausted in 2015. However, there remain a further 3.1-million ounces of recoverable reserves deep underground. &quot;We will start underground production from the end of 2018. The preparatory work for the construction of this underground mine has already begun,&quot; Welborn told Reuters. He added that Syama&#39;s production would be 250 000 oz/y, up from the 200 000 oz it produced as an open pit mine, and it would last until 2028. The necessary investment in the mine would be $100-million, he said. Regarding the Nafolo project, he said &quot;evaluations are in process which in the coming months will yield a precise estimate, but I can tell you already that reserves are going to reach 1.5-million to 2-million ounces.&quot; Mali is the third biggest gold producer in Africa behind South Africa and Ghana, and has attracted investors including Randgold Resources and AngloGold Ashanti.
