JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; West Africa-focused gold producer Perseus Mining on Thursday announced the completion of a drilling programme at its Yaour&eacute; gold project, in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, with the company having received assay results for about 29 300 samples from the programme, which confirm the tenor of mineralisation in holes drilled previously. Results from about 17 000 samples are still outstanding from the drill programme, which started in December last year. The recently completed drilling programmes will provide critical information on which to base a definitive feasibility study (DFS) for the project, which is scheduled to be finalised in the fourth quarter. &ldquo;The results of the drilling programmes are providing our DFS team with a comprehensive understanding of the known mineralisation and the potential for further discoveries at Yaour&eacute;, which is essential if we are to prepare a [study] for an affordable and highly profitable project on which we can confidently base a positive investment decision later this year,&rdquo; said Perseus CEO and MD Jeff Quartermaine. The Yaour&eacute; project is expected to become the ASX-listed company&rsquo;s third operating mine when it is developed and will make a significant contribution towards Perseus&rsquo;s target of producing in excess of 500 000 oz of gold from its West African mines by 2021.
