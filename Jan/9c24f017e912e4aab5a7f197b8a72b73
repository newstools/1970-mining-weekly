LIMA &ndash; Southern Copper should share more of its profits with workers in Peru to avoid an indefinite strike at its Toquepala and Cuajone mines starting on April 10, a union leader said on Tuesday. If confirmed, the strike would follow labour disruptions at Peru&#39;s biggest copper mine, Cerro Verde, and Chile&#39;s Escondida, the world&#39;s largest copper mine, earlier this year. Southern Copper Chief Executive Oscar Gonzalez told Reuters in an interview on Monday a labour agreement with workers was still in force and the company was not planning to give them a bigger share of profits, although it would seek agreement through dialogue. Southern Copper, owned by Grupo Mexico, boosted its copper output by 21% to 900 000 t last year on the back of an expansion at a mine in Mexico. Raul Urere, part of a union that represents 2 200 workers at the Cuajone and Toquelapa mines and the Ilo refinery, said this year workers received between 13 000 soles ($4 000) and 16 000 soles in profit share, less than the 40 000 soles they received last year. &quot;We hope that this is resolved by dialogue and not through a measure of force,&quot; Urere said. &quot;If not, we will use our right to strike. We are also looking for better medical care and other improvements at work.&quot; The union threatening to strike is one of five representing Southern Copper workers in Peru, the world&#39;s No 2 copper producer after Chile. Toquepala and Cuajone, both in southern Peru, together produced some 310 000 t of copper last year, according to government data. &quot;The price of copper improved last year and so did production but we have not had better wages,&quot; Urere said.
