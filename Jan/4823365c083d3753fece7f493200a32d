JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed MOD Resources has discovered significant widths and grades of copper and silver mineralisation below the T3 resource at its Botswana copper project. T3 forms part of a joint venture with Aim-listed Metal Tiger relating to an extensive holding of licences in the central and western parts of the Kalahari Copperbelt in Botswana. The newly intersected zone comprises multiple intervals of disseminated, laminated, cleavage and vein hosted copper sulphides including bornite, chalcocite, covellite and chalcopyrite. &ldquo;This new intersection exceeds the width and grade of the overlying T3 resource, which is several times wider than most copper deposits in the Kalahari Copperbelt,&rdquo; MD Julian Hanna said in a statement on Monday. The newly intersected zone extends over about 72.6 m, from 250 m to 322.6 m down hole depth. Estimated true width may be greater than 50 m based on an early interpretation of the geometry of the intersection. Hanna said the company has not reached the limits of understanding the potential at T3 and needs to rethink ways to upscale production targets and ramp up exploration to a new level.
