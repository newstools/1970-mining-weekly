JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; There is often dispute between mining companies and the families of employees on whether compensation should be paid under either the Compensation for Occupation Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA) or the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA), when an employee passes away at work but due to natural causes. &ldquo;There are often situations where an employee is seriously ill and still comes to work. The employee then dies at his or her place of work and the family then claims for work-related deaths,&rdquo; ENSafrica director Willem le Roux said on Tuesday. He further noted that trade unions also tried to get the Rand Mutual or Compensation Commissioner to accept liability for a fatality, even in cases where persons die of natural causes. This is sometimes due to a misunderstanding of the function of compensation payable under COIDA and ODMWA. To be entitled to compensation under these Acts, the disease or injury, which leads to death, must be work-related. Addressing delegates at the ENSafrica Mine Health and Safety Seminar 2017, in Sandton, Le Roux pointed out that the claimant must prove that the injury or disease, occurred as a result of the employee&rsquo;s working environment. Further, Le Roux noted that general damages, such as pain and suffering, discomfort, disfigurement and loss of amenities of life were not recoverable under either COIDA or ODMWA. He further noted that if a mineworker is diagnosed with a disease after retirement, that person is still able to claim for benefits if they do it timeously and provided such disease is work-related.
