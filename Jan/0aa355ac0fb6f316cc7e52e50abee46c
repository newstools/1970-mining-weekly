PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior Graphex Mining has agreed to the terms of a joint venture (JV) and offtake agreement over its Chilalo graphite project, in Tanzania, with a Chinese syndicate led by CN Docking Joint Investment and Development Co. The syndicate would be required to make an equity investment of between $18-million and $20-million for a 50% JV interest in the Chilalo project, through a project-level incorporated JV. Debt guarantees will also be provided, if required, by both parties for the targeted project finance of up to 65% of the final pre-production capital costs. Furthermore, offtake agreements for a minimum of 50% of the Chilalo product, at market prices, will also be undertaken, with the syndicate to provide assistance to the JV to procure purchasers for the remaining product. &ldquo;We are extremely pleased to have signed a term sheet with CN Docking, which lays out key commercial terms for a JV, offtake and prospective financing arrangements for Chilalo,&rdquo; said Graphex MD Phil Hoskins. &ldquo;This is an important milestone for Graphex, and paves the way for the early development of Chilalo with minimal dilution to our shareholders.&rdquo; Hoskins said that Graphex shareholders would benefit from CN Docking&rsquo;s extensive knowledge of the Chinese graphite market and its strategic interest in graphite, as well as downstream applications such as flame retardant building materials. &ldquo;This relationship is expected to provide strategic opportunities that will enable long-term shareholder value creation well beyond the initial first stage development of Chilalo, which is a world-class deposit.&rdquo; A prefeasibility study on the Chilalo project estimated that a capital injection of $74-million would be required to support average production of 69 000 t/y of graphite concentrate over a ten-year mine life. The two companies will now move forward to prepare detailed documentation, and was hoping to formally execute the agreement within the next three months.
