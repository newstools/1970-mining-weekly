JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mining major Rio Tinto is preparing to challenge amended assessments issued by the Australian Commissioner of Taxation outlining additional taxes due of A$447-million &ndash; A$379-million plus interest of A$68-million &ndash; for the calendar years from 2010 to 2013. This is in addition to the A$25.5-billion of taxes and royalties Rio Tinto paid in Australia during that period. &ldquo;The issue in dispute is the pricing of certain transactions between Rio Tinto entities based in Australia and the group&#39;s commercial centre in Singapore. Rio Tinto voluntarily approached the Australian Tax Office (ATO) more than a decade ago seeking to confirm its pricing arrangements, which Rio believed were in accordance with the internationally recognised Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines and Australian domestic law. &ldquo;The transfer price in dispute is in line with an outcome agreed by the ATO for years prior to 2010,&rdquo; the company said, stating that it will challenge the assessments. &ldquo;The assessments also result in double taxation. Rio Tinto will seek double taxation relief in accordance with the Australia-Singapore double tax treaty,&rdquo; Rio added. In the interim, Rio planned to pay 50% of the total amount to ATO this month.
