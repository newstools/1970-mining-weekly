JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The board of Amur Minerals is considering multiple financing pathways for its flagship Kun-Manie nickel/copper project, in the far-east of Russia, including the possibility of strategic partners and the involvement of various export credit agencies (ECAs). London-based corporate advisory firm Medea Capital has provided the Aim-listed development company with a strategic advisory paper, which concluded that there is available market capacity for investment by a strategic partner and that ECA-covered debt project financing is available for the development of the project. &ldquo;Medea&#39;s comprehensive report has provided the company with the basis for developing a detailed plan and roadmap to full project financing. I look forward to updating the market as we develop and implement this strategic plan and as the company further focuses on its role in developing the Kun-Manie asset,&quot; said CEO Robin Young on Monday. On the advice of Medea, Amur is updating the prefeasibility study for the project to provide the market with updated project economics. Kun-Manie represents one of the largest potential sulphide nickel operations in the world. The project has a 101.3-million tonne ore resource, containing recoverable nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum and palladium, with an average nickel equivalent grade of 1.03%. The total nickel equivalent tonnage is 1.04-million tonnes. Amur has the right to recover 100% of the contained metal based on a 20-year production licence expiring July 1, 2035. Engineering and metallurgical testwork has established a first-stage production plan, targetting output of six-million tonnes a year of ore, generating about 50 000 t of nickel.
