JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gahcho Ku&eacute;, the world&rsquo;s largest new diamond mine in 13 years, has officially started commercial production. The mine, developed in a joint venture between De Beers Group and Mountain Province Diamonds, is expected to produce about 54-million carats of rough diamonds over its mine life. The fly-in, fly-out remote mine site is situated 280 km northeast of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Comprising three openpits, the mine will employ 530 people full-time, with the majority working a two-week in/two-week out rotation. Production ramp-up began in August 2016 and the official opening ceremony took place in September. &ldquo;The mine has reached this landmark, on budget and ahead of schedule, and is set to deliver socioeconomic benefits of more than C$5-billion to the economy of Canada&rsquo;s Northwest Territories over its lifetime,&rdquo; De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver said in a statement issued on Thursday. According to a socioeconomic impact report compiled by EY, the mine is estimated to provide a further C$5.3-billion in gross value-add to the Northwest Territories now that it has reached commercial production. This is in addition to a C$440-million contribution to the Northwest Territories economy in 2015.
