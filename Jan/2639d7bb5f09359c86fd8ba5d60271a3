WARSAW &ndash; Poland&#39;s JSW, the European Union&#39;s biggest coking coal producer, reported on Wednesday it made a net profit of 864.53-million zlotys ($231.3-million) in the first quarter, thanks to a surge in coal prices and cost cutting. Analysts had expected JSW to report a net profit of 744-million zlotys, the company having made a net loss of 60-million zlotys in the same period last year. The state-controlled company, which nearly collapsed in 2015 following a slump in coking coal prices, is expected by some analysts to report a net profit of almost 3-billion zlotys this year thanks to higher prices and reduced costs. First-quarter sales revenue rose nearly 70% to 2.38 billion zlotys. Earlier this month, the company&#39;s acting chief executive, Daniel Ozon, said that JSW might resume paying a dividend on this year&#39;s results.
