MELBOURNE - BHP Billiton said on Thursday it has lifted a declaration of force majeure at its Escondida copper mine in Chile, more than a month after a costly strike came to an end. BHP declared force majeure at the mine in early February at the start of a labour strike that lasted 43 days and cost the world&#39;s biggest mining house an estimated $1-billion. &quot;I&#39;m pleased to say that our copper FM (force majeure) is lifted as of today. We are back to normal,&quot; BHP&#39;s chief commercial officer, Arnoud Balhuizen told reporters after addressing a mining luncheon. Force majeure remained in place on shipments from its coal mines in Australia&#39;s Queensland state, where a cyclone in late March knocked out rail haul lines, Balhuizen said. &quot;We still need a bit of time to get to full normal shipments in coal,&quot; he said.
