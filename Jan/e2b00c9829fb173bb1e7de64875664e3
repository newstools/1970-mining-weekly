LIMA &ndash; Workers at Brazilian group Votorantim&#39;s Cajamarquilla zinc smelter, in Peru, plan to start an indefinite strike on May 6, demanding a bigger share of profits and better working conditions, a union leader said on Thursday. The union of 350 workers plans its first strike in 16 years, saying the company has not shared profits since 2012 and workers only receive a fixed annual bonus, union leader Daniel Trejo said. Votorantim Metais said in an e-mailed statement it complied with legal and labour norms and considered the strike illegal. The company is open to dialogue, it said. &quot;As the company has not adhered to our demands, we have submitted our notice of indefinite general strike for next Saturday, May 6,&quot; Trejo told Reuters. The Cajamarquilla plant, located 20 km east of Lima, last year refined some 340 000 t of zinc. Votorantim Metais also operates the Peruvian copper and zinc producer Milpo which operates the Cerro Lindo mine, located south of Lima.
