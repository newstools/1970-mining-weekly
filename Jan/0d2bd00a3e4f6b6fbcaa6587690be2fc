LIMA &ndash; Peru&#39;s government on Monday sharply raised its trade balance forecast for this year to a surplus of $3.71-billion from a $776-million surplus expected previously, due to higher commodity prices. In an update to its official macroeconomic forecasts, the Economy and Finance ministry confirmed its expectations for 3% economic growth this year, down from a 4.8% forecast last August. The ministry revised its 2018 growth forecast up to 4.5% from 4.3% projected previously. Finance Minister Alfredo Thorne had already lowered 2017 growth expectations to 3.8% after a graft scandal paralysed public works projects, and to 3% due to floods in recent months. Peru is the world&#39;s second-largest copper producer and No 3 producer of zinc. The ministry said it expected current account deficits equivalent to 2.6% of gross domestic product in both 2017 and 2018, down from the 3.1% and 3% deficits, respectively, seen previously. It revised its 2018 trade account forecast to a surplus of $3.43-billion, up from a $717-million surplus seen previously.
