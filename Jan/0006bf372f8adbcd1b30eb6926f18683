PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mining major BHP Billiton&rsquo;s plan for its Southern Flank iron-ore deposit, in the Pilbara, is open for public comment. BHP is seeking environmental approval to include the Southern Flank orebody into its Mining Area C operations, which will require the clearing of an additional 19 850 ha of land and extending the Mining Area C development by 10 218 ha. The miner previously flagged the development of Southern Flank as a replacement for the 80-million-tonne-a-year Yandi mine, which is likely to be depleted over the next five to ten years. BHP asset president Western Australia iron-ore Edgar Basto previously said that the Southern Flank deposit was the preferred long-term solution for extending iron-ore production in the Pilbara, and that the investment case for using this deposit for replacement tonnes was strong, given the ability to leverage aspects of the existing infrastructure at the Mining Area C operation and the ore quality. The public review period will run for four weeks.
