VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Multinational miner Kinross Gold has posted slightly better first-quarter headline earnings as metals prices improved in the period ended March. Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders were $23.4-million, or $0.02 a share, compared with $21.2-million, or $0.02 a share, for the same period in 2016, comfortably beating market forecasts calling for a loss of $0.03 a share. During the first quarter, net earnings amounted to $134.6-million, or $0.11 a share, compared with $35-million, or $0.03 a share, in the same period of 2016. The change was mainly attributed to in operating earnings, and the reversal of a previous impairment charge booked on the Cerro Casale project, in Chile. On March 28, Kinross announced it has entered into an agreement to sell its 25% interest in the Cerro Casale, and its 100% interest in the Quebrada Seca exploration project to Goldcorp. As the selling price is higher than the carrying value, the Kinross recorded a reversal of previously recorded impairment charges of $97-million. Revenue in the period rose slightly to $796.1-million, based on total gold equivalent sold of 652 516 oz, compared with $782.6-million on sales of 664 165 oz of gold equivalent ounces during the first quarter of 2016. The average gold price realised in the first quarter was $1 220/oz, compared with $1 179/oz a year earlier. Kinross reported costs of $701/oz of gold equivalent sold, up from $687/oz a year earlier, and all-in sustaining costs came in at $953/oz of gold equivalent, marginally lower compared with $956/oz a year earlier. Kinross&rsquo; attributable output fell 2% year-over-year to 671 956 oz of gold equivalent, as lower output at Kupol, in Russia, because of a decrease in grades and at Maricunga, because of the suspension of mining and crushing activities on the back of water curtailment orders by Chile&rsquo;s environmental enforcement authority. These decreases were partially offset by higher production at Bald Mountain, in the US, due to an increase in mining activities, and at Tasiast, in Mauritania, and Chirano, in Ghana, owing to higher grades. Gold equivalent ounces sold in the quarter fell to 652 516 oz, compared with 664 165 oz in the comparable period of 2016, mainly owing to lower output. The average gold price realised increased from $1 179/oz in the first quarter of 2016, to $1 220/oz in the quarter under review. Kinross, which is active in Canada, the US, the Russian Federation, Brazil, Chile, Ghana and Mauritania, confirmed its full-year guidance at between 2.5-milliona and 2.7-million gold equivalent ounces. The company expects to be within its production cost of sales guidance range of $660/oz to $720/oz of gold equivalent and its all-in sustaining cost guidance range of $925/oz to $1 025/oz gold equivalent sold in 2017. Kinross also expects to make capital expenditures of about $900-million this year.
