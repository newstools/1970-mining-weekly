GABORONE &ndash; Botswana&#39;s government has offered its State-owned BCL Mine to the Emirates Investment House (EIH) for a token price of $1 in a deal that will result in the Emirati firm taking over the mine&#39;s debts, minerals minister Sadique Kebonang said. Since being placed under provisional liquidation in October for an initial period of four months, the High Court has granted two extensions to BCL as the government negotiated with potential buyers. BCL Mine (BCL) was placed under provisional liquidation in October last year after its creditors demanded close to P1-billion ($96-million). &quot;We have signed a memorandum of understanding with EIH. The proposal is for them to take up all of BCL debts including Nkomati for a token fee,&quot; Kebonang said. BCL has more than 5 000 direct jobs and is the lifeblood of the Selebi Phikwe mining town of over 50 000 residents. After BCL was placed under provisional liquidation, Russia&#39;s Norilsk Nickel took legal action against the mining group to recover $271.3-million it says it is owed for the sale of a 50% stake in the Nkomati JV in South Africa.
