LONDON &ndash; Shareholder advisory group ISS on Wednesday changed its recommendation ahead of Petropavlovsk&#39;s annual general meeting next week, saying shareholders should oppose the reappointment of Peter Hambro, who has led the company for decades. It had previously recommended rejecting changes proposed by dissident shareholders. &quot;We have changed our vote recommendations and now support the election of two of the dissident nominees. We also recommend a vote against the re-election of former executive chairperson Peter Hambro,&quot; ISS said in a report on Wednesday.
