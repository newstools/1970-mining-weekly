PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Project partners Anglo American and Highlands Pacific will extend the exploration campaign at the Star Mountain copper/gold project, in Papua New Guinea, after encouraging drilling results. The ASX-listed Highlands Pacific said on Thursday that the latest results from the Fune prospect had indicated a potentially significant copper/gold skarn mineralisation, with the joint venture partners now planning to drill additional holes to further test this anomaly. Further drilling will also be required at the Unfin prospect. &ldquo;The drilling programme is providing valuable information that is greatly enhancing our understanding of the geology and leads us to undertake more work,&rdquo; said Highlands CEO Craig Lennon. &ldquo;Every hole provides further indications that Star Mountain may host a large copper porphyry that could ultimately underpin a significant mining project.&rdquo;
