We are well positioned to achieve our revised gold production and cost guidance for the year, ranking the company in the bottom quartile on the global gold producers AISC curve,&quot; noted Perry. In the quarter under review, Centerra&rsquo;s company-wide AISC on a by-product basis per ounce sold&nbsp;amounted to $742, excluding revenue-based tax in the Kyrgyz Republic and income tax.

The company&#39;s results include its Idaho-based Thompson Creek operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
