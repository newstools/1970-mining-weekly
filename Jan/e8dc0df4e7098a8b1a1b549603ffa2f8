NEW DELHI &ndash; India&#39;s National Aluminium Company (Nalco) has put all its overseas projects, including the one in Iran on hold, to focus on expanding domestic capacity, its chairperson said on Monday. &quot;Iran&#39;s proposal is attractive as long as gas prices are attractive, but not much of an indication in that area has come,&quot; chairperson Tapan Kumar Chand told Reuters. India&#39;s third-largest producer of aluminium plans to increase its production by 14% to 440 000 t in 2017/18, Chand said.
