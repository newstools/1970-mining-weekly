JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Savannah Resources has raised the resource estimate for its Mutamba mineral sands project, in Mozambique, after evaluating drilling results from the Ravene deposit. The Ravene resource has been found to contain a high-grade portion of 92-million tonnes at 6.2% total heavy materials (THM),&nbsp;which will be a primary focus within the scoping study that is being carried out. &quot;The increased mineral resource for the Mutamba project highlights its potential to be a significant producer of titanium feedstocks,&rdquo; CEO David Archer said in a statement. He added that, this year, the company is seeing increasing prices for titanium feedstocks such as ilmenite and rutile, &ldquo;which means that it is an ideal time to be taking this project forward.&rdquo; The inferred mineral resource estimate at Ravene stands at 900-million tonnes at 4.1% THM. It brings the total global mineral resource estimate for the Mutamba project to 4.4-billion THM tons, representing a 26% increase. Savannah defined the resource at Ravene using samples from initial drilling of 119 holes completed between 2002 and 2004, and from the recent drilling of 107 holes.
