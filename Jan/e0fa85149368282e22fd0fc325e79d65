PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Production from the Edna Beryl gold mine will start before the end of the year, after the Northern Territory government granted final approvals for the start of production. ASX-listed Emmerson Resources said on Friday that the Edna Beryl mine would be the first new gold mine in the Northern Territory for over a decade, and was a testament to the territory government&rsquo;s revitalisation of Tennant Creek as a major mining centre. &ldquo;The commencement of production at Edna Beryl is a pivotal step since Emmerson began exploration in the Tennant Creek mineral field in 2008. It not only provides a revenue stream but establishes a template for unlocking value in many of our other projects contained within our extensive 3 000 km2 tenement package,&rdquo; said Emmerson MD Rob Bills. Emmerson and its partner, fellow-listed Evolution Mining, in August 2015, inked a tribute agreement with Edna Beryl Mining Company, allowing that company to start permitting work for the Edna Beryl gold mine within Emmerson&rsquo;s Northern project area. Small-scale mining at Edna Beryl is also being undertaken by the Edna Beryl Mining Company under the tribute agreement. Bills said on Friday that the tribute style of agreement maximised value and mitigated risk, while providing great insights for Emmerson&rsquo;s near-mine and regional exploration programmes.
