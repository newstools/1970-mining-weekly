JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-listed silver ore producer Great Panther Silver has acquired the Peru-based Coricancha gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper underground mine and mill complex (CMC) from subsidiaries of integrated mining and metals company Nyrstar. The acquisition was completed on June 30 as a share purchase. Great Panther will pay a purchase price to Nyrstar of $0.1-million, as well as an earn-out consideration of up to $10-million.&nbsp; Under the earn-out, Nyrstar will be paid 15% of the free cash flow generated by CMC over the next five years, after which CMC&rsquo;s cumulative free cash flow will be in the black.&nbsp; &quot;The acquisition of CMC represents a major milestone for Great Panther and the culmination of our search for the right asset to build a foundation in Peru,&quot; said CEO Robert Archer in a statement released Monday. Great Panther&#39;s plans include further evaluations of the current mine and processing infrastructure, mine rehabilitation and development in preparation for underground drilling, environmental studies, and the initiation of a preliminary feasibility study (PFS). Depending on the outcome of the PFS, capital investments in support of restarting operations could begin in 2018.&nbsp; The company is currently working on an updated mineral resource estimate for CMC, which is expected to be completed towards the end of the third quarter of 2017.
