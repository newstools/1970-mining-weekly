PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Perth-based Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has flagged a potential redomiciling to the US, along with either a listing on the NYSE or Nasdaq. The ASX-listed company on Thursday told shareholders that the board had been evaluating a US listing, with the belief that such a transaction could be of benefit to the company and its shareholders as LNG progressed towards the developments of its projects in North America. A timetable for a decision has not yet been specified for the potential transaction, with LNG telling shareholders that details would be announced once a decision had been taken and once the structure and timing of any proposed transaction had been determined, including whether LNG would remain listed on the ASX. LNG is developing the eight-million-tonne-a-year Magnolia LNG project in Louisiana, in the US, and the eight-million- to twelve-million-tonne-a-year Bear Head LNG project in Canada.
