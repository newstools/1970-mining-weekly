PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Coal miner New Hope on Wednesday reported that its 40%-held subsidiary, Bengalla Mining Company (BMC), has started proceedings in the Land and Environment Court in New South Wales, to prohibit MACH Energy Australia from carrying out further development of its Mount Pleasant project. The BMC is seeking a restraining order on any further development at Mount Pleasant subject to MACH satisfying the terms of its development consent. MACH is developing the 10.5-million-tonne-a-year Mount Pleasant operation, adjacent to the Bengalla mine, with the aim of being in production by the first quarter of 2018. The opencut operation will produce thermal coal for export to international markets. MACH acquired the Mount Pleasant thermal coal assets from mining giant Rio Tinto in August last year for $220.7-million, plus royalties.
