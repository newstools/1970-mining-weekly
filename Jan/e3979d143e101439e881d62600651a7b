JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; An updated mineral resource estimate at the Misisi gold project, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has shown the project holds around 1.57-million ounces of gold. Aim-listed Ortac Resources holds an interest in the project through its shareholding in project owner Casa Mining. Ortac on Monday pointed out that a report compiled by African Mining Consultants showed that the gold can be exploited at an average grade of 2.27 g/t, using a $1 250/oz gold price and a conservative 1.50 g/t cutoff grade. Ortac CEO Vassilios Carellas commented that this was an &ldquo;extremely positive development&rdquo; for the miner, as it demonstrated the clear potential to increase the gold mineral resources at the project&rsquo;s Akyanga deposit. &ldquo;With the overall resource now at over 1.5-million ounces, and the extensions to the open-ended mineralisation about to be tested by the upcoming drill programme, the geology is very much pointing positively towards the view that a commercially viable and recoverable gold asset is about to be proven in what is a free milling orebody,&rdquo; he highlighted.
