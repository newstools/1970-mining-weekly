PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Copper miner Tiger Resources expects to lose some 100 t of production during March, as repairs to the tank leach circuit at its Kipoi project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are under way. Tiger previously reported damage to its tank leach circuit components, including the pump mixers. The company on Thursday said the tank leach circuit had now been shut for the repair of the two pump mixers. The repairs are estimated to take seven days. Tiger on Thursday also confirmed ongoing discussions with major shareholders and the senior lending group to address short- and medium-term cash flow issues. The miner is expected to provide an update on these discussions at a later date.
