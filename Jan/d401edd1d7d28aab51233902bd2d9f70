PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Northern Territory&rsquo;s plans for a mining hub at Tennant Creek have been given a boost with energy transporter Jemena given a pipeline licence for the development of the Northern gas pipeline project. The A$800-million, 622-km pipeline will link Tennant Creek in the Territory to Mount Isa in Queensland, with first gas expected to flow in 2018. Minister for Primary Industry and Resources Ken Vowles said a consent to construct the Phillip Creek station compressor facility, north of Tennant Creek had also been granted. &ldquo;Significant milestones have now been reached in the development of this major project,&rdquo; Vowles said. &ldquo;This is an important job-creating project for the Territory, it will generate around 900 jobs during construction and will support our government&rsquo;s plans to develop Tennant Creek as a resources industry services hub which will see many ongoing jobs.&rdquo; The Territory government recently announced a decision to invest in a feasibility study to construct a common-user mine and processing facility in Tennant Creek. The feasibility study would determine the viability of the common-user mine and facility, which would allow small mining operations to get under way without the need for major investment in processing solutions.
