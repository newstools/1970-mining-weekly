SYDNEY - BHP Billiton said on Wednesday it has started a sales process to potentially divest its Cerro Colorado copper mine in Chile, one of its smaller operations in South America. &quot;The evaluation is at an early stage, no final decisions have been made and there is no guarantee that a transaction will result,&quot; BHP said in a statement emailed to Reuters. Cerro Colorado is located in Chile&#39;s Tarapac&aacute; Region and yielded 77 000 t of copper in fiscal 2016. BHP&#39;s flagship mine, Escondida, also in Chile, yields more than 10 times that amount annually. Banking sources have named Chile&#39;s Empresas Copec SA , a conglomerate that has voiced interest in diversifying into copper, and Canadian companies such as Lundin Mining Corp, as possible buyers. BHP has earmarked large long-life copper mining as a key growth sector in years to come as expansion work in its iron ore mining business in Australia slows down.
