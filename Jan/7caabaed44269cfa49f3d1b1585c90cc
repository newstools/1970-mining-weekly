SANTIAGO &ndash; The Collahuasi copper mine, in Chile, which is among the world&#39;s biggest, expects output this year to beat last year&#39;s, and could ramp up production that was frozen in 2015 if the copper price keeps rising, the mine&#39;s CEO told Reuters Tuesday. The mine, a joint venture between Anglo American and Glencore, is also expecting to begin maintenance on a milling plant in April that should last around two months, said Jorge Gomez, on the sidelines of the CRU World Copper Conference in Santiago.
