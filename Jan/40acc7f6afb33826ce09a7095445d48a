VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Canadian gold major Goldcorp has secured an 80.5% interest in Exeter Resource Corp. The acquisition is part of a series of transactions that will result in the creation of a new 50:50 joint venture (JV) between Goldcorp and Barrick Gold over a new project located in the Atacama region of Chile, that combines Barrick and Kinross Gold&rsquo;s Cerro Casale project, with Exeter&rsquo;s Caspiche project. Goldcorp reported after market close on Wednesday that nearly 75-million Exeter shares had been successfully tendered, and accepted following the deadline on Wednesday afternoon, and Goldcorp now plans to replace the current Exeter board and carry out a compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction to acquire any Exeter shares that are not validly deposited under the offer. Exeter is being acquired for $185-million in Goldcorp shares, exchanged on a 0.12 basis, valuing Exeter at C$2.58 a share, a 67% premium over March 27, the last trading day before the offer was announced. Goldcorp announced a mandatory extension of the Exeter offer to 17:00 EST on June 20. Exeter&rsquo;s Caspiche project is about 10 km from Cerro Casale, which is currently a JV project between Kinross and Barrick, but will become a JV between Goldcorp and Barrick.
