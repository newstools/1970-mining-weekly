KIMBERLEY &ndash; Kumba Iron Ore representatives are expected to enter into mediation talks with the Dingleton community this week in a bid to resolve a dispute over land in the area. Kumba wants to relocate the entire town of Dingleton in the Northern Cape to a town 25 km away, GroundUp reported. Only 25 families remain and are refusing to move on Kumba&#39;s terms. &quot;We are hoping the mediation will assist us in the interpretation of the International Finance Corporate Guidelines. These are the guidelines that Kumba must comply to,&quot; said Richard Spoor, an attorney representing some Dingleton residents. Kumba has denied this claim. Kumba says residents are &quot;disrupting the process of rehabilitating&quot; a site near the railway where blue asbestos was spilled years ago. The company needs to rehabilitate the site in order to expand its Sishen iron-ore mine near Dingleton. Spoor told GroundUp that a court case that was lodged against Dingleton residents in February by Kumba was ongoing. He said the matter &quot;was likely&quot; to be resolved soon. Kumba is demanding over R1.6-million from residents who refused to relocate. &quot;The case will be stayed [meaning further legal procedures will halt] pending the outcome of the mediation process,&quot; said Spoor. &quot;The conditions in Dingleton are intolerable,&quot; said Spoor. &quot;We&rsquo;d like to reach an agreement of terms of the resettlement of residents.&quot; He said the mediation would be facilitated by human rights attorney Brian Currin.
