PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The South Australian Magnetite Consortium has inked another sale and purchasing letter of intent (LoI), this time with Chinese steel company Sha Steel, for the acquisition of two-million tonnes a year of iron-ore concentrate for sinter feed blends. ASX-listed Magnetite Mines chairperson Gordon Toll said on Monday that the LoI created a value-adding relationship with one of the largest, most efficient and entrepreneurial steel companies in the world. &ldquo;This LoI adds to previously announced agreements with Chinese steel companies Shandong Steel, Qingdao Steel and Ningbo Iron and Steel, plus additional agreements with two non-Chinese steelmakers. It clearly emphasises the demand for our high-quality products,&rdquo; he added. The South Australian Magnetite Consortium comprises Magnetite Mines and Lodestone Equities, which through its subsidiaries FE Mines and Olary Magnetite, holds rights to prospective tenements in South Australia. The consortium&#39;s assets include the Mawson iron-ore project, which contains the Ironback Hill prospect, and is estimated to host more than one-billion tonnes of resource. With the latest LoI in place, the consortium now has a total of eight-million tonnes a year of possible offtake, subject to LoI&rsquo;s, ready for conversion to firm sales contracts.
