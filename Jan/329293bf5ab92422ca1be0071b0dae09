PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The prefeasibility study (PFS) into the Odysseus nickel project, in Western Australia, has estimated that the project could deliver an average of 12 000 t/y of nickel in concentrate over an initial seven-and-a-half-year mine life. Owner Western Areas on Thursday said the PFS estimated the project will require a capital expenditure of between A$190-million and A$210-million, which would also fund the definitive feasibility study (DFS), to develop the Odysseus project. The PFS estimated that the project will have a pre-tax net present value of A$292-million and an internal rate of return of 28%, with life-of-mine C1 cash costs estimated at around A$3.21/lb, including cobalt by-products and an all-in sustaining unit cash cost of A$3.69/lb. Western Areas MD Dan Lougher told shareholders that the PFS results demonstrated the healthy operational and financial characteristics of the Odysseus project. &ldquo;The positive results of the PFS, combined with the recent drilling success achieved within 18 months of acquisition, demonstrate Western Areas&rsquo; ability to accelerate and deliver value from the Cosmos acquisition.&rdquo; &ldquo;Odysseus represents Western Areas&rsquo; next mining operation and the results presented today show that a significant nickel operation can be established for substantially less capital outlay than a standalone greenfield development.&rdquo; Lougher said the company believed there was significant opportunity to drive further improvements in returns on the investment, including the potential for significant high-grade resources below the existing deposit. &ldquo;Odysseus is a core growth asset for Western Areas with exciting upside potential and progressing this to DFS stage will ensure that Western Areas is ready to leverage an upswing in nickel prices. &ldquo;Being a conventional underground nickel sulphate project, it is a great fit with our core skills and experience in hard rock underground mining and conventional nickel flotation at Forrestania,&rdquo; Lougher added. Western Areas will now undertake a DFS at Odysseus, and will also work to upgrade a major portion of the inferred ore resource to the indicated category, with further metallurgical work and potential drilling also planned. Western Areas is expected to spend some A$7-million on the project in the 2017 financial year and a further A$34-million in 2018, with first ore expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 and concentrate in the first quarter of 2021.
