PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Brazil-focused gold miner Orinoco Gold has appointed Craig Dawson as COO, effective immediately. He has more than 30 years&#39; experience in the Australian and international mining industry and has held senior operational positions at a number of midtier and global mining companies, including GM at Norilsk Nickel, GM at the Nifty copper mine, held by Aditya Birla, and GM of operations at the DeGrussa copper mine, owned by Sandfire Resources. Dawson will travel to the Cascavel gold mine to oversee the return of operations, as well as the planned ramp-up to achieve commercial production in the second half of this year. Orinoco MD Mark Papendieck described Dawson as a practical, hands-on manager and a strong team player whose skills and expertise would be important for the company. &ldquo;We are now moving into a crucial phase with mine development recommencing in early April, in line with our new mine plan and work set to begin shortly on finalising the required mill improvements,&quot; Papendieck said.
