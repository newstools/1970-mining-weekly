RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO &ndash; Consulting firms ISS and Glass Lewis have given a nod of approval to a restructuring plan for Brazilian miner Vale, boosting the chances of shareholder approval, a source said on Wednesday. The corporate restructuring process, announced on February 20, seeks to strengthen the company&#39;s compliance and will be voted on at an extraordinary shareholders&#39; meeting on June 27. The consulting firms are advising shareholders who will attend the meeting. &quot;They approved it unanimously. This is extremely positive because it demonstrates that the operation is well-regarded by the market, which increases the probability of approval significantly,&quot; the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Last month, Vale&#39;s board of directors approved a final proposal by Valepar, the company&#39;s controlling shareholder, for a restructuring that includes plans for the miner to have no defined controlling shareholder and list on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. Vale&#39;s preferential shares closed down 1.37% on Wednesday while ordinary shares lost 1.02%.
