JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Trans-Siberian Gold&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary ZAO Trevozhnoye Zarevo (TZ) on Thursday entered into a three-year agreement with VTB Bank for an additional $5-million debt facility. The company on Wednesday secured a five-year $15-million facility with the bank, aimed at repaying two existing loan facilities amounting to $14.8-million and to provide additional funds for working capital and other corporate purposes. The terms of this new facility represent a material improvement on the terms of TZ&#39;s previous borrowing, with the yearly interest rate having been reduced by 30%, the miner noted.
