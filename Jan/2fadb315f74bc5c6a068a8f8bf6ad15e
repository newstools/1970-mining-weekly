MOSCOW &ndash; Russian gold producer Nord Gold SE delayed the de-listing of its global depository receipts (GDRs) from the London Stock Exchange to March 16 from March 9, the company said on Monday. The delay in the delisting date was agreed in order to align it with the date upon which the tender offer for the GDRs closes. Nordgold, which said last month it would de-list, said it believed its market capitalisation did not accurately reflect the true value of the company.
