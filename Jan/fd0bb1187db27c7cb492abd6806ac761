JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Dual-listed Sibanye&rsquo;s platinum division delivered pleasing results during the quarter ended March 31, producing 286 716 oz of platinum-group metals at an operating cost of R11 128/oz. This resulted in operating profit of R243-million, excluding the equity accounted attributable operating profit of R119-million from its Mimosa mine. The miner noted that the integration of the South African platinum operations continued to progress well. &ldquo;The Sibanye operating model has been implemented across the division and positive operating and financial performance momentum has already been noted. There has been a real 12% reduction in Rustenburg&rsquo;s unit operating costs since Sibanye took control of the operation on November 1, 2016,&rdquo; it stated. After taking into account the revenue contribution from base metals and chrome, Kroondal, Platinum Mile and Rustenburg delivered attributable operating profits of R77-million, R15-million and R122-million respectively for the quarter. This equated to a quarterly operating profit margin of 12%, 35% and 5% respectively for each operation. Meanwhile, Sibanye&rsquo;s gold production for the March quarter of 330 100 oz, was 9% lower than in the comparable quarter in 2016, mainly as a result of the cessation of mining operations at the Cooke 4 shaft in September 2016. Gold in inventory at the end of December 2016 of 4 147 oz was sold during the March quarter, resulting in sales of 334 200 oz. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) increased by 9% from R454 282/kg to R493 862/kg mainly as a result of the decrease in gold produced.
