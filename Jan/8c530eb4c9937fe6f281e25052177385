PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Coal developer Aspire Mining has moved a step closer to the development of its Nuurstei coking coal project, in Mongolia, with the Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia approving the registration of the project. The registration is necessary before a mining licence can be issued, and allows the project joint venture (JV) partners to lodge the previously prepared general environmental impact assessment (GEIA). On the acceptance of the GEIA, the JV partners could pay the application and licence fees. Aspire was hoping to secure the project&rsquo;s mining licence within the next few weeks, with the licence expected to allow for tenure over the deposit for an initial 30 years.
