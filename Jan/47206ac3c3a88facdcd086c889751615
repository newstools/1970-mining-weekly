MUMBAI &ndash; Diversified miner Vedanta said on Thursday its 500 000 t aluminium smelter in the eastern state of Odisha was hit by a power outage this week that damaged over one-third of its processing capacity. The company said 228 out of a total of 608 pots that process molten aluminium were damaged by the outage. &quot;The impacted pots will require to be repaired over the next few months, and put back into production. Timelines will be announced in due course,&quot; the statement said. The per day output of each pot is about 2.5 t, a source familiar with the company&#39;s operations said. The incident could result in a loss of roughly 30 000 t of production in the next three months, a customer who does business with the company told Reuters. That would equate to roughly 25% of the plant&#39;s quarterly production. &quot;It usually takes three months in case of damaged pots to bring them back to production,&quot; the customer said. Vedanta runs two smelters at its Jharsuguda plant, the second is a 1.25-million tonnes smelter. Aluminium production is a highly power intensive activity and requires constant supply of power 24 hours a day. Any power supply cut beyond four hours could lead to molten aluminium solidifying in the pots leading to wastage of metal and cost to the company. &quot;This requires an expensive rebuilding process,&quot; said a note available on the company&#39;s website. The recovery process is underway, however, the scope of the impact is being analysed, two Vedanta executives said.
