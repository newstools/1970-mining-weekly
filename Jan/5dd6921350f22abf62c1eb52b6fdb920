JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Afarak&rsquo;s Mogale operation is now using all its operating furnaces to produce ferrochrome following the successful transition of a second furnace from silicomanganese to ferrochrome. Prior to December 2016, Mogale only had one furnace dedicated to ferrochrome.&nbsp; Owing to improved market conditions, Afarak successfully converted another two of its furnaces from producing silicomanganese to ferrochrome &ndash; the first in December and the second this month. &ldquo;It is expected that the new furnace will produce an additional 2 300 t/m. In addition, opencast mining at Mecklenburg, in Limpopo, has resumed and preparations are under way for underground mining with the potential of accessing 20-million tons of chrome reserves,&rdquo; Afarak CEO Guy Konsbruck said on Tuesday.
