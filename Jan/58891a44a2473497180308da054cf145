JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Trade union Solidarity on Monday expressed concern about the rise in fatalities in the mining industry in the first two months of this year. This comes after the latest provisional statistics for January 1 to February 27 showed an increase in fatalities to eight, from five in the first two months of 2016. &nbsp; &ldquo;This represents a 60% increase,&rdquo; Solidarity occupational health and safety deputy general secretary Paul Mardon said. &nbsp; He pointed out that&nbsp;fall-of-ground, transportation and general accidents, including employees being overcome by gas, are the biggest contributors to fatalities. &ldquo;Apart from illegal mining, this poses a serious threat to the safety of employees in the mining industry,&rdquo; he added. &nbsp; Solidarity is urging employers to renew efforts to prevent any further fatalities in mines. &nbsp; &ldquo;We are pleading with employers to involve trade unions more often in their health and safety training decisions. It is also important that employers be more supportive and involved with health and safety training by trade unions,&rdquo; he said.
