PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified major BHP has agreed to a new strategic assessment programme with the federal government that locks in environmental standards and protection measures in the Pilbara. Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said on Friday that the programme would protect the unique environment of the Pilbara and support environmentally sustainable development of iron-ore mines. Under the new strategic assessment programme, BHP will consult the community on new activities, invest to safeguard Australia&rsquo;s nationally protected species and report publicly on their environmental performance. The programme will be subject to regulatory oversight by the federal government, with regular review and approval required, and a limit on environmental impacts. &ldquo;The approval provides BHP with certainty for their ongoing iron-ore business, which currently employs around 16 000 people. The first new mine is likely to be a multibillion-dollar investment that will create up to 2 500 construction jobs. &ldquo;Investment by BHP in conservation measures across the Pilbara will benefit nationally protected species. This gives the community confidence that environmental standards must be applied to all future mining activity,&rdquo; Frydenberg said. &ldquo;This is a great outcome for nationally protected species including the northern quoll, the Pilbara leaf nosed bat and the Pilbara olive python.&rdquo;
