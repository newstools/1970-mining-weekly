BENGALURU &ndash; Gold hit a two-week high on Wednesday as Asian stocks slipped and the dollar fell amid political uncertainty after a source said US President Donald Trump asked the FBI to end a probe into his former security adviser. Spot gold climbed 0.6% to $1 243.31/oz by 07:46 GMT, after earlier touching its strongest since May 3 at $1 244.70. Gold has risen for five days straight. US gold futures were up 0.6% at $1 243.50/oz. Trump asked his now-dismissed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey to end a probe into ties between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia, according to a source who has seen a memo written by Comey. The memo raises questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. The White House denied the report. &quot;An inherently weaker dollar was seen because of the Trump rhetoric,&quot; said analyst Barnabas Gan at OCBC. &quot;Safe-haven demand because of Trump and geopolitical tensions, especially arising out of North Korea&#39;s missile test, is lifting gold prices.&quot; &quot;People could be looking for a short-term support at $1 240 levels,&quot; he added. Distractions at the White House lower the chances of the administration enacting a legislation that is important to markets, namely tax and regulatory relief as well as infrastructure spending, said INTL FC Stone analyst Edward Meir. &quot;A lack of progress on these issues should theoretically contribute to the Fed holding a more dovish course for longer, hurting the dollar and possibly equities in the longer term, but likely proving beneficial for gold,&quot; he said. The Fed is still likely to raise interest rates next month, with futures traders pricing in a 74% chance of a hike. Spot gold faces a resistance at $1 245/oz and may temporarily hover below this level or retrace to a support at $1 237.26 before retesting this barrier, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. The dollar index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, touched its lowest since Nov. 9 and last stood at 98.112. The dollar has taken a hit from solid eurozone economic data, a fall in US yields on heightened turmoil in Washington and downbeat housing data. MSCI&#39;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.5%. Among other precious metals, silver marked its highest since May 2 and was up 0.3% at $16.87/oz. Platinum earlier touched its highest since May 1 but was dipped 0.1% at $936.74/oz. Palladium slipped 0.3% to $791.50.
