PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior Magmatic Resources&rsquo; joint venture with Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (Jogmec) over the Parkes copper/gold project, in New South Wales, has been enacted, with the first exploration spend agreed. Under the terms of the March JV, Jogmec can earn a 51% interest in the two exploration tenements making up the Parkes project by funding up to A$3-million. The two companies have now agreed to a A$1-million exploration programme over the first year of the earn-in, with drilling planned to start in either October or November this year. Under the terms of the JV, Jogmec would be required to spend a minimum of A$300 000 before being able to withdraw from the JV agreement. &ldquo;We are delighted to partner with Jogmec, one of the world&rsquo;s leading greenfield exploration entities,&rdquo; said Magmatic MD David Richardson. He noted that the Japanese company&rsquo;s history of copper/gold porphyry exploration success, combined with Magmatic&rsquo;s own technical team should prove the best opportunity for exploration success. The Parkes JV is only the fifth JV that Jogmec has in Australia.
