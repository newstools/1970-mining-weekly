JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Exploration and development company Beowulf has raised &pound;1.5-million to support its iron-ore, polymetallic and graphite activities in Sweden and Finland, the Aim-listed company reported on Wednesday. The funds will be used for a scoping study on the Kallak magnetite iron-ore project and to support the 2017 &Aring;tvidaberg polyemetallic exploration programme in Sweden. Its exploration and development activities in Finland will also benefit from the funds raised. &quot;I have been back in Jokkmokk [Sweden] this week, continuing to share our vision for Kallak, and what we believe a modern and sustainable mining operation could positively do for Jokkmokk&#39;s future,&rdquo; commented CEO Kurt Budge. In April, Beowulf presented an analysis of the indirect effects of a mining operation at Kallak on Laponia with respect to reindeer herding, and the effects of transport on Laponia. The company appointed Naturv&aring;rdsverket and Riksantikvarie&auml;mbetet to carry out a heritage impact assessment in the area. The analysis, which followed United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation guidelines, highlighted that a mining operation at Kallak will have no direct impact on Laponia. Budge noted that Beowulf was waiting for the County Administrative Board&#39;s response to the Mining Inspectorate, which is expected by June 16. Kallak is 13.6 km2 compared with Laponia&#39;s 9 400 km2 and, at its closest point, Kallak is almost 34 km away from Laponia.
