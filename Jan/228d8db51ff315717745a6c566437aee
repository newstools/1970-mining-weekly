JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Employees at Harmony Gold&rsquo;s Kusasalethu mine, near Carletonville, have again on Friday not reported to work, owing to ongoing industrial action. Employees embarked on the industrial action on Thursday, with Harmony saying this was in retaliation for its suspension of Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) branch leadership that had encouraged an earlier go-slow at the mine. Harmony spokesperson Marian van der Walt told Mining Weekly Online on Friday morning that employees had also failed to report for the Thursday night shift. The gold miner suspended the branch leadership after only 25% of the Kusasalethu workforce reported for duty on Wednesday. That go-slow was in response to disciplinary procedures against 40 employees, following an illegal sit-in at Kusasalethu in January, when around 1 700 employees staged a 48-hour wildcat underground sit-in. The miner on Thursday sought an urgent meeting with the AMCU leadership to discuss ways of resolving the industrial action, but no engagements have been held yet.
