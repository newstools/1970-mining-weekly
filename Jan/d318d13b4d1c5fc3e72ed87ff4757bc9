JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Kiziltepe precious metals mine in Turkey is gearing up for commercial production to start soon, as the ramp-up of the mine continues to meet, or exceed, the expectations of joint venture partners Ariana and Proccea Construction. In an operational update published on Friday, 50%-owner Ariana reported that the processing plant was operating to design specifications, with mill availability having increased to more than 97% in June. The company also said that process recoveries of gold and silver were trending higher than feasibility-study expectations and that leach times remained faster than predicted. To date, the refinery has sold about 1 930 oz of gold at price ranging from $1 225/oz to $1 295/oz, and 14 520 oz of silver, at a price ranging from $16.20/oz to $18.20/oz. The mine would pour a further 354 oz of gold and 3 125 oz of silver on Friday, which would take the month&rsquo;s gold and silver production to 621 oz and 9 064 oz, respectively. The Kiziltepe operation is currently expected to deliver about 20 000 oz gold equivalent a year over eight years of initial mine life, for a total of up to 160 000 oz gold equivalent based on current resources. Once the mine transitions to commercial production, Ariana would start issuing quarterly operational updates.
