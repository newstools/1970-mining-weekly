JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified mining company South32 has awarded a three-year, R158-million contract at the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex to 100% black-owned Modi Mining, which aims to source up to 90% of its labour from the nearby communities. The award marks an advance on the ASX- and JSE-listed company&rsquo;s plans for a more inclusive supplier landscape. &ldquo;Transformation is central to our efforts to make a meaningful contribution to the social and economic development of South Africa,&rdquo; said South32 president and COO Africa Mike Fraser in a release to Mining Weekly Online. In an Investing in African Mining Indaba address in February, Fraser emphasised the need for a supportive legislative, regulatory and administrative environment for inclusive growth solutions to realise their full potential. He expressed the view at the Indaba that while mining still represented a significant vehicle for driving inclusive growth, it remained legislatively challenged, with above-inflation costs rendering high-quality resources less accessible. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get on the same playing field and face the same goal, then regardless of the country&rsquo;s natural endowments, South Africa&rsquo;s mining industry is at risk of not realising its potential,&rdquo; Fraser warned in his pre-Mining Charter Three address. The triple-listed South32, with operations in Australia, Southern Africa and South America, produces coal, manganese ore, manganese alloy and aluminium locally.
