MOSCOW &ndash; Russia has appointed Sergey Ivanov Jr, son of the former head of the Kremlin administration, as chief executive of State-controlled diamond miner Alrosa, the government said on Monday. Ivanov&#39;s candidacy to lead the world&#39;s largest diamond producer was supported by the finance ministry, sources familiar with situation and the ministry have said. The contract with Ivanov, 36, who has served as a senior vice-president of Russia&#39;s largest lender Sberbank since April 2016 and headed insurer SOGAZ before that, will be for three years, a document on a government website showed. &quot;On the one hand, Ivanov lacks industry experience, but on the other hand he joins from Sberbank&#39;s management team, which is well perceived by the market,&quot; VTB Capital said in a recent note. Alrosa&#39;s former chief executive Andrey Zharkov is leaving the post ahead of schedule. Zharkov has been in dispute over Alrosa&#39;s 2017 budget with the finance ministry, the Kommersant newspaper has said, citing sources. Alrosa is the world&#39;s largest producer of rough diamonds in carat terms. Together with Anglo American&#39;s De Beers unit, the two produce about half the world&#39;s rough diamonds. The Russian government sold a 10.9% stake in Alrosa last year, raising $813-million to plug holes in the budget as part of a privatisation programme. The State plans to cut its stake in Alrosa further to 25% plus one share by 2019, but the finance ministry has said no sale is planned in 2017. The federal government and the government of the Yakutia, together with its districts - where Alrosa&#39;s main producing assets are based in Russia&#39;s far east - currently each hold 33% of Alrosa&#39;s shares. The shares were down 0.3% in Moscow on Monday, compared with a 0.2% rise in the MICEX index.
