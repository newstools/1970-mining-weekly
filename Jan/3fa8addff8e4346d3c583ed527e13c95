PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Gold Road Resources has awarded a A$298-million engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract to a joint venture between Amec Foster Wheeler and Civmec, or the ACJV, for the Gruyere gold project, in Western Australia. The award of the EPC contract will allow for work on the design, procurement and installation of the process plant and associated infrastructure to start. &ldquo;This is another key milestone in the delivery of Gruyere into production and we look forward to work on the plant and associated infrastructure commencing in earnest on site,&rdquo; said Gold Road MD and CEO Ian Murray. &ldquo;Importantly, this contract will focus on maximising the local content in the construction of Gruyere and generating significant employment opportunities in the Goldfields region and Western Australia more broadly,&rdquo; he added. The fabrication of the process plant and other project infrastructure was expected to provide direct work for between 30 and 50 people, with the ACJV expected to have a total workforce of around 300 people at peak construction. ACJV will start mobilising to Gruyere in August. The Gruyere plant will have a capacity to handle 7.5-million tonnes a year of fresh ore, and up to 8.8-million tonnes a year of oxide ore, over a mine life of 13 years.
