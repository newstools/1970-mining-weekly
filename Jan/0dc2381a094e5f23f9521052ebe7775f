PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mining at the Coolgardie gold project, in Western Australia, is slated to start in the fourth quarter of this year, with project owner Primary Gold saying that a prefeasibility study on the initial project is progressing well. Mining will start in December at the starter pits of MacPhersons, A Cap and Tycho, with Primary telling shareholders that several ore processing options are still being assessed. Meanwhile, mining contractors have been invited to tender on the mining schedule and final tenders are due at the end of June. Clearing permits, prescribed premises and groundwater extraction licence applications have also been submitted to the relevant authorities for assessment, Primary said on Thursday. The Coolgardie project was acquired in 2016, and hosts an existing resource of 3.81-million tonnes, at 1.63 g/t gold for 200 600 oz of gold.
