PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Tarcoola gold mine, in South Australia, has set a number of production records in May, since operations were restarted at the start of the month. ASX-listed WPG Resources on Wednesday reported a record 27 104 t of ore, at an average grade of 2.57 g/t gold was mined at the operation, containing 2 239 oz of gold. A record of more than 1 790 oz of gold in ore was hauled to WPG&rsquo;s Challenger processing hub during the month. In addition, a daily record of 786 t of ore was hauled from Tarcoola to Challenger on May 30. &ldquo;Tarcoola is now starting to hit its straps. Blending Tarcoola and Challenger ore at the processing hub allows us to present a consistent and optimum ore stream to the mill,&rdquo; said WPG chairperson Bob Duffin. &ldquo;Our Tarcoola strategy is working.&rdquo; Mining operations at Tarcoola were halted in April this year, following two significant rainfall events, however, milling operations continued unabated.
