MELBOURNE &ndash; Fortescue Metals Group is making iron-ore marketing forays to steel-producing nations outside China to tap forecast increases in demand from burgeoning infrastructure projects across the region. The world&rsquo;s fourth-biggest exporter&rsquo;s mines in northwestern Australia are well-positioned to take advantage of expected growth in countries such as India, Vietnam and the Philippines, CFO Elizabeth Gaines said in an interview. Australian iron-ore exporters including Perth-based Fortescue account for more than half of the global export market. &ldquo;Our marketing team visit potential and prospective customers in all those regions regularly - it&rsquo;s not just a complacent watching brief,&rdquo; said Gaines, who took the post in February having served on the miner&rsquo;s board since 2013. &ldquo;We are actually in those markets talking to people and wanting to be partners with them as those opportunities arise.&rdquo; India is poised to become a beacon for growth in global steel output as demand from infrastructure, construction and auto-making accelerates, BMI Research said in a report received Wednesday. Steel output in the nation will average annual growth of about 9% between 2017 to 2021, according to the report. Economic growth is forecast to pick up in about two-thirds of Asia&rsquo;s 45 economies, even as the pace of expansion cools in China, the Asian Development Bank said this month in its latest outlook report. India&rsquo;s gross domestic product is forecast to grow 7.4% in 2017 and 7.6% next year, while in Southeast Asia &ndash; which includes Vietnam and the Philippines &ndash; GDP growth will expand to 5% in 2018 from 4.8% this year, the report said. &ldquo;As those economies realize their growth potential there&rsquo;ll be demand for infrastructure, which will drive demand for steel,&rdquo; Gaines said in the interview Wednesday in Sydney. &ldquo;Being based in the Pilbara, we&rsquo;ll be very well placed to supply to those markets as and when that demand occurs.&rdquo; Fortescue declined 1.4% to A$6.21 at 10:36 a.m. in Sydney trading, trimming its advance in the past 12 months to 140%. A rally in iron-ore since late 2015 that&rsquo;s swelled profits and allowed producers to trim debt and boost returns to investors is losing momentum. Prices have slumped about 15% since the steel-making ingredient touched a more than two-and-a-half-year high of $94.86 a metric tonne in February. Benchmark ore in Qingdao declined 0.8% to $80.92/t Thursday, according to Metal Bulletin Fortescue&rsquo;s efforts to more than halve cash costs in the past two years to about $12.54/t in the last quarter mean that it&rsquo;ll remain &ldquo;bullet-proof&rdquo; even as prices retreat, chairperson and founder Andrew Forrest said in an interview last month. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not finished there, we&rsquo;re looking at continuing to focus on innovation, on efficiency and productivity benefits to continue to be the lowest cost producer,&rdquo; Gaines said. Fortescue was ranked the lowest-cost seaborne supplier to China in a Metalytics Resource Sector Economics study, the producer said in a December filing. Operating costs are the sector&rsquo;s third-lowest behind larger rivals BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fortescue may target early repayment of $478-million of April 2022 notes that are callable from this month as it looks to extend a drive to cut debt and will also consider further options for broader changes to its borrowings, according to Gaines. The producer has cut net borrowings to about $4-billion at the end of December from a peak of $10.7-billion four years earlier. &ldquo;Part of the opportunity is looking at the remaining debt and how we might structure that,&rdquo; she said. The producer is also likely to consider what it wants to do with $2.16-billion of 9.75% secured 2022 notes as they become callable from March next year. &ldquo;Clearly that&rsquo;s expensive debt,&rdquo; Gaines said.
