DAR ES SALAAM &ndash; Tanzania&#39;s government and Canada&#39;s Barrick Gold have started talks to resolve a tax dispute involving Acacia Mining, the President&#39;s office said on Monday. The government accuses Acacia, in which Barrick holds a majority stake, of evading taxes over the years by under-declaring exports. Acacia denies the accusations, which have pummelled its share price. &quot;Talks between a special committee formed by President John Magufuli and representatives of Barrick Gold Corp . . . started today in Dar es Salaam,&quot; a statement from the Presidency said.
