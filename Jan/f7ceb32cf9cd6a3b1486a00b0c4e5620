JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-V-listed Diamcor Mining&rsquo;s second rough diamonds tender and sale from its Krone-Endora at Venetia mine, in the Northern Cape, has generated $702 635 in gross proceeds from the sale of 3 265 ct ranging in the 1 mm to -45 mm size fractions. This represents an average price of $215.20/ct. The tender included the sale of three rough diamonds in the specials category &ndash; bigger than 10.8 ct. These were a 12.80 ct diamond, a 12.89 ct gem quality diamond and a 13.51 ct diamond. The sale also brought the total rough diamonds tendered and sold from processing through the newly expanded facilities to 6 165 ct, with seven individual rough diamonds being in the specials category. The miner plans to complete a third tender and sale prior to the end of the current quarter.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very pleased with the results of these initial tenders and sales of rough diamonds from our newly expanded facilities, especially at a time when many operators are experiencing lower-than-expected results due to continued weakness in rough diamond prices,&rdquo; noted Diamcor CEO Dean Taylor.
