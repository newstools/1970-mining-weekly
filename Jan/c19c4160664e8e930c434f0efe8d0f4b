PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior explorer Laconia Resources has been granted two new prospecting licences over the Kraaipan West gold/nickel/copper/platinum group metals project, in Botswana. The project area covers some 15 km of the Amalia-Kraaipan greenstone terrane, which is thought to be highly prospective for both gold and magmatic nickel/copper/platinum group metal sulphide mineralisation. The newly acquired prospecting licences are some 30 km west of Laconia&rsquo;s existing Kraaipan gold/nickel/copper/platinum group metals project. ASX-listed Laconia said on Wednesday that it would immediately start a comprehensive, targeted exploration programme at its flagship Kraaipan project, and if the exploration techniques employed proved successful, these would also be applied to the Kraaipan West project.
