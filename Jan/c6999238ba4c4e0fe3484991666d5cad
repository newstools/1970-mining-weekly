JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Uranium project developer Berkeley Energia has appointed Adam Parker as independent nonexecutive, strengthening the company&rsquo;s commitment to build an Europe-focused board. The ASX- and Aim-listed company, which is bringing the Salamanca mine in western Spain into production, recently also appointed London-based, former Rio Tinto executive Nigel Jones as nonexecutive director. Parker joins the company after a long career in institutional fund management in London spanning almost three decades, including being a cofounder of Majedie Asset Management, which today manages assets of about &pound;14-billion. Parker retired from Majedie Asset Management in 2015 and has no ongoing input or influence in the management of its investments, including the firm&#39;s current ownership of about 5.30% of the company. &quot;We are delighted that Mr Parker has joined our board, bringing with him a wealth of financial and corporate experience gained over an extensive career in London financial markets,&rdquo; said Berkeley MD Paul Atherley. The Salamanca project is expected to deliver about 4.3-million pounds a year of uranium oxide over a mine life of 18 years.
