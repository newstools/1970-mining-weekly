PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The capital cost of the Gruyere gold joint venture (JV), in Western Australia, has increased from A$507-million to A$532-million, following an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) review by the JV partners. ASX-listed Gold Road Resources on Wednesday told shareholders that since the JV was formed with South Africa&rsquo;s Gold Fields, the partners have been working on a detailed review of the feasibility study, which has resulted in a number of improvements and enhancements to the project. &ldquo;We are very pleased with the continued improvements to the project, and that after careful scrutiny, the capital cost estimate has been restrained within the feasibility study cost estimate error range,&rdquo; said Gold Road MD and CEO Ian Murray. The JV partners recently awarded a A$298-million EPC contract for the gold project, and have signed an A$585-million power supply contract with APA Group that will see APA design, build, own and operate a 198 km pipeline and a 45 MW gas-fired power station to support the gold project. Contracts have also been awarded for long-lead items, such as the primary crusher, and semiautogenous grinding and ball mills. The Gruyere plant will have a capacity to handle 7.5-million tonnes a year of fresh ore, and up to 8.8-million tonnes a year of oxide ore, over a mine life of 13 years. Construction completion has been tipped for December next year, with first gold expected in the first quarter of 2019.
