JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Emerging African graphite producer Walkabout Resources is embarking on a fully underwritten share purchase plan to raise $1.25-million for the purposes of progressing its Lindi Jumbo project, in Tanzania, as well as working capital. This follows the completion of a definitive feasibility study at the project, which indicated &ldquo;very robust&rdquo; economics for the project. Walkabout chairperson Trevor Benson noted on Monday that finalising the funding pathway remained the top priority for the Lindi Jumbo executive team. &ldquo;Ongoing discussions, although not finalised, are progressing with interest having been received across Europe and China,&rdquo; he said. The miner is following a range of options insofar as securing project funding goes, with the company expecting to adopt a staged process, made up of a range of equity and mezzanine debt linked to a combination of build contracts and the primary asset valuation. Meanwhile, the company noted that it had also received its environmental impact compliance certificate for the project &ndash; &ldquo;a major regulatory milestone&rdquo;, as it opened the pathway for the mining licence application to be submitted. The application was now in final preparation and will be submitted to the online portal shortly.
