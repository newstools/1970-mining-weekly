JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Africa-focused platinum group metals (PGM) miner Ivanhoe Mines has appointed mine-financing institutions KfW IPEX-Bank and the Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK) to arrange project financing for the development of the Platreef project in South Africa&rsquo;s Limpopo province. The German government-owned KfW IPEX-Bank and SEK will join Export Development Canada, Nedbank Limited &ndash; acting through its corporate and investment banking division &ndash; and Societe Generale Corporate &amp; Investment Banking, all appointed earlier this year, as initial mandated lead arrangers (IMLAs). The IMLAs have committed to raising a total debt financing of up to $1-billion for the development of Platreef&rsquo;s first-phase, four-million-tonne-a-year mine, with preliminary expressions of interest currently received for about $900-million of the targeted $1-billion in financing. This financing will be contingent on a successful due diligence process, including benchmarking the project against the International Financial Corporation&rsquo;s environmental and social performance standards.&nbsp; Earlier this month Ivanhoe&rsquo;s finance team met with all five IMLAs to negotiate a term sheet. This was followed by a site visit to the Platreef project. &quot;With KfW IPEX-Bank&rsquo;s and SEK&rsquo;s involvement, and with the indications of interest received from lenders totalling $900-million, we have great confidence that we will reach our total debt financing target,&quot; noted Ivanhoe executive chairperson Robert Friedland.&nbsp; &quot;We are thrilled by the addition of SEK and KfW IPEX-Bank to the IMLA group [as they] bring extensive experience in mining project finance, in particular in export and import finance, and bring with them the potential for significant German and Swedish government backing,&quot; he added.&nbsp; The Platreef project, which is 64% owned by Ivanhoe, is a tier-one PGM, nickel, copper and gold discovery on the northern limb of South Africa&rsquo;s Bushveld Igneous Complex, the world&rsquo;s premier platinum-producing region.
