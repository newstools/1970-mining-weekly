BENGALURU, India &ndash; Investment manager Orbis Investment Management on Friday disclosed a stake of about 2.8% in US specialty metals maker Arconic Inc, and said it intends to support hedge fund Elliott Management in its proxy battle against the company. Bermuda-based investment manager Orbis said it intends to vote in favour of Elliott&#39; slate of independent nominees to join Arconic&#39;s board. Arconic has been under pressure from activist investor Elliott, which last week stepped up pressure for CEO Klaus Kleinfeld&#39;s ouster after raising its stake in the company to about 13%. In January, Elliott had nominated five directors to Arconic&#39;s board. Orbis said on Friday it does not believe that Arconic can reflect its true value under the leadership of Kleinfeld.
