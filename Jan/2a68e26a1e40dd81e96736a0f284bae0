VANCOUVER &ndash; Newmont Mining on Monday became the latest of the world&#39;s biggest gold miners to invest in Canada&#39;s Yukon territory, the site of a famous gold rush 120 years ago, as miners hunt for rich, new deposits in safe regions. US-based Newmont, the world&#39;s No 2 gold producer, unveiled an agreement with small explorer Goldstrike Resources to spend $39.5-million to explore and develop Goldstrike&#39;s Plateau property, in the Yukon. With this deal, Newmont follows moves by rivals Goldcorp Inc and Agnico Eagle Mines last year into the northwestern Canadian territory at a time when gold miners are loosening their purse strings after five years of belt-tightening when bullion prices fell. &quot;It&#39;s a stable mining jurisdiction with high-quality gold prospects,&quot; Newmont spokesperson Omar Jabara said. Goldcorp, the world&#39;s fourth biggest gold producer by ounces, started off the mini-stampede last May when it paid C$520-million for Kaminak Gold and its Yukon-based Coffee gold project. A month later it acquired an almost 20% stake in Independence Gold, which owns a neighbouring property. In December, Agnico Eagle, the world&#39;s ninth biggest gold producer, bought a stake in a Yukon-focused miner. The Klondike region of the Yukon was the centre of a stampede of some 100 000 treasure seekers between 1896-1899 after gold was discovered in the area. Fortunes were made but many left empty-handed, with some heading on to Alaska after gold was discovered there in 1899.
