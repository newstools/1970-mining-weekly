JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Shares in Aim-qouted Tri-Star Resources surged on Tuesday as the company announced Traxys Europe will supply antimony and antimony gold concentrates to its project in Oman. Tri-Star owns an equity interest in Strategic &amp; Precious Metals Processing (SPMP), which is building the Oman Antimony Roaster (OAR) project in the Port of Sohar Free Zone. SPMP CEO and Tri-Star deputy chairperson Emin Eyi said the agreement brought &ldquo;considerable value&rdquo; to the project.&nbsp; &ldquo;Work has already commenced with the Traxys team in identifying and approaching major suppliers of antimony and antimony gold concentrates at a time when some 50% of China&#39;s antimony smelters are shuttered pending environmental concerns,&quot; he commented in a statement. Traxys will act as supplier to SPMP of concentrates and direct shipping ores as feedstock for the OAR for an initial five years from the first shipment.&nbsp; The cost to SPMP will be based on the purchase contract cost incurred by Traxys plus an agreed sourcing fee and transactional expenses.&nbsp; The raw materials will be delivered to, and warehoused by, Traxys until required by SPMP. Tri-Star has a 40% equity interest in SPMP, with the other joint venture partners being Oman Investment Fund and DNR Industries. Tri-Star traded 70% higher at 0.24p a share on Tuesday afternoon after having touched 0.28p a share earlier in the day.
