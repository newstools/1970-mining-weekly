NEW YORK &ndash; Specialty metals producer Arconic Inc said its shareholders had elected three of Elliott Management Corp&#39;s nominees to its board of directors, based on a preliminary vote count following the company&#39;s annual meeting on Thursday. Elliott, a New York hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, struck a deal with Arconic on Monday, ending a prolonged battle for control of the company&#39;s board. From the start of its public campaign in January, Elliott said Arconic, the $12-billion company that separated from Alcoa Corp last year, needed new leadership and that its performance had missed targets and lagged peers. Elliott&#39;s elected nominees are Christopher Ayers, former chief executive of specialty steel wire ropes maker WireCo WorldGroup, Carlyle Group LP&#39;s operating executive Elmer Doty and Patrice Merrin, who currently sits on the board of commodities trading group Glencore. David Hess, Arconic&#39;s interim CEO, and Ulrich Schmidt, the former finance chief of aircraft parts maker Spirit AeroSystems, were also elected to the company&#39;s board, Arconic said. Hess and Schmidt were Arconic&#39;s nominees. Former Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief Jim Albaugh was named to Arconic&#39;s board to fill a vacancy, the company said. Arconic&#39;s shares were down 3% at $27.26 in midday trading on Thursday. Up to Wednesday&#39;s close, the stock had risen 51.5% this year, compared with a 7.4% increase in the S&amp;P 500 .
