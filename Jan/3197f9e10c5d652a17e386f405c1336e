PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior copper developer Hot Chili is hoping to raise up to A$13-million through a private placement to refund its outstanding debt and fund exploration work. The ASX-listed company on Friday said it had arranged an offering of unsecured convertible notes, with the funding to be led by lender Sprott Capital Partners. The notes will have a maturity of five years and a conversion price of 3.3c per ordinary share, with the conversion price representing a strong premium to Hot Chili&rsquo;s closing price of 2.5c a share on March 16. The proceeds will be used to repay the company&rsquo;s outstanding $6.5-million loan facility with Sprott and will provide for exploration capital for the Productora copper project, in Chile. &ldquo;Paying off our debt and ensuring the company is well-positioned with funds are key near-term financing targets for Hot Chili,&rdquo; MD Christian Easterday said on Friday. &ldquo;On completion of the funding, the company will be significantly derisked and able to take advantage of improving copper market conditions and success from the drill bit.&rdquo;
