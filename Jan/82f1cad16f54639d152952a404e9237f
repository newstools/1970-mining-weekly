PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Indian major Adani has struck a deal with the Queensland government on royalty payments for its $16.5-billion Carmichael coal mine. The royalty arrangement, which was backed by the state Cabinet, meant that the project was back on track, with Adani&rsquo;s board expected to make a final investment decision on the project during the next board meeting. Adani has previously vowed to pay &lsquo;every cent&rsquo; of its full royalties bill for the Carmichael project. The proposed Carmichael project will comprise an opencut and underground mine, running for a period of 90 years and producing an average 60-million tonnes a year of thermal coal. The project was expected to generate some 10 00 direct and indirect jobs. The project also includes a new 388 km standard gauge rail line to a new terminal at Abbot Point port near Bowen.
