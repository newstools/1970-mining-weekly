JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Edenville Energy on Thursday said its mining licence ML362/2016, covering its Mkomolo coal project, in south-west Tanzania, has been enlarged to 9.88 km&sup2;. The amalgamation of the 14 primary mining licences located at Mkomolo is now entirely held in one continuous licence area under the name of Edenville International Tanzania. &ldquo;We are pleased this process has been completed which will allow the smooth expansion of the entire Mkomolo mining area,&rdquo; Edenville CEO Rufus Short said in an update to shareholders. The company is in the process of developing the site, which includes the construction of a coal washing plant, that will be used to produce a range of coal products for local and regional use. Further, Edenville secured prospecting licence PL11342/2016, just west of the enlarged mining licence, which covers an area of 29.62 km2 and is referred to as the Nkasi block. &ldquo;The prospecting licence covers the remaining Mkomolo coal measures and allows the company to carry out further exploration work as necessary, and if appropriate, incorporate these resources into an expanded mining plan around the development of a mine mouth power plant,&rdquo; he concluded.
