LONDON &ndash; Global diversified natural resource company Glencore has closed a $7.34-billion, one-year revolving credit facility that refinances an existing $7.7-billion, one-year revolver that was agreed in February 2016, the company said on Wednesday. The one-year loan, which finances Glencore&#39;s trading operations, is part of a bigger loan package that also includes an existing $6.8-billion medium-term loan. The unsecured facility has a 12-month extension option and a 12-month term-out option, which extends the final maturity until May 2019. The facility has no financial covenants. The financing was launched at $5-billion and closed substantially oversubscribed after raising $8.55-billion in syndication from Glencore&rsquo;s wide and supportive group of relationship banks. A total of 56 banks committed to the facility, including 31 mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners. Due to the low average utilisation of the company&rsquo;s combined short and medium term facilities, the one-year facility was reduced to $7.34-billlon. Citigroup, Commerzbank, Standard Charted and UniCredit were active bookrunners on the financing.
