PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Indian major Adani has awarded an A$82-million contract to Rockhampton-based Austrak to supply concrete sleepers to the Carmichael coal and rail project, in Queensland. &ldquo;Adani promised that regional Queenslanders would benefit from our project, and here&rsquo;s proof that we honour our promises and we care about regional Queenslanders,&rdquo; said Adani&rsquo;s Australian head of country and CEO Jeyakumar Janakaraj. The concrete sleeper contract comes shortly after Adani awarded a A$74-million contract to Arrium Mining and Materials for the supply of around 54 000 t of railway tracks. Adani recently struck a tax deal with the Queensland government regarding royalty payments for its $16.5-billion Carmichael project. While the details of the deal remained obscured, Adani has promised to pay every cent of its full royalties bill for the proposed 60-million-tonne-a-year thermal coal project.
