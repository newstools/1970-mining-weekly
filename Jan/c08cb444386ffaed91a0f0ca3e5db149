JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Harmony Gold has issued an ultimatum, calling for striking workers at its Kusasalethu mine to return to work by Tuesday night or face disciplinary action. The Labour Court of South Africa on Friday granted an interdict declaring ongoing industrial action at the Kusasalethu mine unprotected and ordering employees to return to work. Harmony on Monday said that it and recognised unions, including the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), have entered into various labour agreements since 2013. &quot;Despite reaching these agreements, AMCU and its members have, since the start of 2017, continued to disrupt operations, threatening the safety of Harmony&#39;s employees and impacting negatively on production.&quot; It noted that, despite the court interdict, no employees had reported for work over the weekend or Monday. Harmony pointed out that it had lost some seven to ten days&#39; of production at Kusasalethu since march 21. &quot;Given the history of this mine and the serious impact that continued production interruptions could have on the lives of our employees and their families, we call on AMCU to show responsible leadership. We urge employees at Kusasalethu to return to work,&rdquo; CEO Peter Steenkamp said. &nbsp;
