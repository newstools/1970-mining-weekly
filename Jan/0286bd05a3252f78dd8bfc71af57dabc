GUATEMALA CITY &ndash; Guatemala&#39;s Supreme Court on Thursday confirmed a preliminary decision to suspend two mining licences belonging to the local unit of Canadian miner Tahoe Resources, citing violation of indigenous people&#39;s rights to be consulted. The decision affects the Escobal mine, Tahoe&#39;s flagship mine and one of the world&#39;s largest silver mines, as well as the company&#39;s smaller Juan Bosco unit. Both are located in eastern Guatemala. Tahoe&#39;s local unit San Rafael quickly filed an appeal with Guatemala&#39;s constitutional court, the country&#39;s top judicial authority, seeking to overturn the decision. &quot;Today we are appealing to the constitutional court and we hope that the judges can take it up quickly because we&#39;re concerned about the 1 600 direct jobs generated by the mines,&quot; San Rafael spokesperson Andres Davila told Reuters. The appeal could take weeks, said Davila. Officials with the constitutional court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Local business association CACIF also weighed in against the suspension, calling it an &quot;arbitrary and irresponsible&quot; decision. While the Supreme Court ruled that San Rafael did not consult indigenous communities, Guatemala&#39;s energy and mining ministry has said that the company &quot;did undertake a process of dialogue with affected communities.&quot; Davila said the company has already suspended operations at the mines, but has asked for permission to allow water to be pumped from the tunnels to prevent flooding.
