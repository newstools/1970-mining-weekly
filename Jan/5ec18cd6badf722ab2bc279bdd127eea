PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Australian junior Acacia Coal has completed a prefeasibility study (PFS) for the Riversdale anthracite colliery, in South Africa, which estimates that the project will require a capital investment of A$24-million. The project, which Rio Tinto sold to Acacia Coal last year, is expected to produce 438 000 t/y of low impurity anthracite coal and will generate free operating cash flow of A$14.5-million over an eight-year mine life. The project is expected to have a net present value of A$73-million and an internal rate of return of 53%, with the capital pay-back period has been estimated at just under three years. Acacia MD Hugh Callaghan said on Tuesday that a combination of the extremely high quality nature of the Riversdale coal and the declining inventory of metallurgical coal in South Africa, was at the heart of the project&rsquo;s strong outlook. &ldquo;The PFS shows that the Riversdale colliery project ticks every box, ranging from a premium-quality product through to low cost and strong margins. The project is ideally placed to capitalise on the strong supply-demand fundamentals in the South African premium metallurgical coal market.&rdquo; Acacia will now submit an integrated water use licence application in May, and based on discussions to date, expected to receive its final outstanding regulatory approval by mid-2018. A feasibility study into the project will start in July.
