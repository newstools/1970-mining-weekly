BUENOS AIRES &ndash; Union representatives and executives from miner Southern Copper, in Peru, failed to reach an agreement to end an indefinite strike after a long meeting on Monday night, the union said on Tuesday. The company did not agree to the union&#39;s main demand for a greater share of profits, Raul Urere, a leader of a union representing 2 200 workers, told Reuters. He said another meeting was scheduled for Wednesday. The strike started on Monday following labour disruptions at Peru&#39;s biggest copper mine, Cerro Verde, and Chile&#39;s Escondida, the world&#39;s largest copper mine, earlier this year. Southern Copper said on Monday operations were little affected, with the Cuajone and Toquepala mines producing at 98%, while the Ilo refinery was operating at full capacity. The union said 80% of operating capacity had been impacted, however. Southern Copper, owned by Grupo Mexico, boosted its copper output by 21% to 900 000 t last year on the back of an expansion at a mine in Mexico.
