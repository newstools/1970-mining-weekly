JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Sula Iron &amp; Gold has conditionally raised &pound;500 000 through a placing by investment bank VSA Capital and Africa-focused miner Madini Minerals for 129-million new ordinary shares at an issue price of 0.40p a share. The issue price represents a discount of 13%. The placing will support the development of its Ferensola project in Sierra Leone, which is highly prospective for gold, coltan and iron-ore. &ldquo;The board believes this placing is a particularly strong endorsement of the company&#39;s strategy at Ferensola. With two drill rigs and associated equipment now on site and drilling at the Ferensola project under way, the company is in a strong position to expand on its originally planned exploration programme of 2 400 m, potentially enabling a larger Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant exploration target to be identified,&quot; CEO Roger Murphy said in a statement.
