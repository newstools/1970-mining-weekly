PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; An independent assessment has estimated that the Dartbrook project, in New South Wales, contained some 2.5-billion tonnes of coal resource. ASX-listed Australian Pacific Coal on Tuesday said that some 588-million tonnes were classified as measured with a further 850-million tonnes classified as indicated. &ldquo;This resource statement confirms Dartbrook is one of the largest underdeveloped coal deposits in the Hunter Valley. This reaffirms our long-held belief that Dartbrook is a tier-one surface mining asset that has the potential to create a significant number of job opportunities for the local community,&rdquo; said Australian Pacific Coal CEO John Robinson. He noted that the high-energy, low-emissions quality of Dartbrook&rsquo;s coal will also help meet global demand for Australian low ash premium thermal coal, which will continue to play a critical role in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions while at the same time meeting future energy needs. Australian Pacific Coal in May completed the purchase of diversified miner Anglo American&rsquo;s 83.33% interest in the Dartbrook mine in a deal valued at A$50-million.
