JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Drilling, aimed at testing extensions of lithium-tin mineralisation at Plymouth Minerals&rsquo; San Jose project, in Spain, has started. The ASX-listed company, which is developing the project in an earn-in joint venture with Spanish company Sacyr and its wholly owned subsidiary Valoriza Mineria, on Thursday said it would drill mineralisation extensions, which are currently part of the exploration target. Additional drilling in areas already defined as containing resources in the inferred category will be undertaken with a view to increase resources confidence to the indicated category. Plymouth can earn up to 75% of San Jose by completing a feasibility study within four years and investing A$6-million in capital expenditure.
