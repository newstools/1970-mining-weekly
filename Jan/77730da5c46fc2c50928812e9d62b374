PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Western Australian resources sector has welcomed the Labor party&rsquo;s landslide victory over the weekend. Voters overwhelmingly supported the removal of the Liberal party from power in Western Australia during the state elections held over the weekend, opting for the Labor party and its leader Mark McGowan, who will now be appointed as Premier. The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) and the Western Australian Chamber of Minerals and Energy (CME) have both expressed their welcome, with AMEC CEO Simon Bennison saying on Monday that the industry was looking forward to working with the newly elected Premier. &ldquo;AMEC will work closely with the new government, particularly on the need to reduce the cost of doing business and lift investment in mineral exploration to discover the mines of tomorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Western Australian Labor must use this opportunity to improve Western Australia&rsquo;s international competitiveness, create jobs and attract mining and mineral exploration investment.&rdquo; CME CEO Reg Howard-Smith on Monday said that, as a former state Development Minister and Minister for Environment, McGowan had a good understanding of the issues facing the resources sector. &ldquo;We are pleased the Labor government will not implement the job-destroying iron-ore mining tax as proposed by the Western Australian Nationals. Based on the election results there is no mandate for this tax to be implemented and CME is pleased Labor stand firmly against this bad policy,&rdquo; Howard-Smith said.
