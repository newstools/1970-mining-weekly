SANTIAGO &ndash; Chile, the world&#39;s biggest copper producer, faced a fresh threat of labour action in the sector on Wednesday when a union at the large Chuquicamata mine said it had blocked access as a &quot;warning&quot; over planned changes to job opportunities. Mine owner Codelco said the union&#39;s action, which affected the early shift, was &quot;illegal.&quot; It ended by 9 am and the impact on production was being evaluated, it said in a statement. Earlier, Codelco said output had been unaffected as workers from the previous shift had continued to keep operations going. The state-run company signed new 27-month contracts with its six Chuquicamata unions in December after relatively rapid talks. However, union No 1 said Wednesday that the contracts were not being fulfilled, as Codelco was making changes that were reducing the possibility of promotion. &quot;They are cutting off the careers of Chuqui workers, particularly the youngest,&quot; union leader Jaime Graz told Reuters. &quot;This is a warning action until they commit to comply with what was agreed.&quot; Codelco said it was complying with the agreed contract terms. &quot;It is not possible to open up and hire for positions that are not needed by the business,&quot; it said, adding that it was inviting &quot;constructive dialogue.&quot; The union&#39;s move came less than a month after the end of a six-week strike at BHP Billiton&#39;s massive Escondida copper mine, which was the longest strike in the country&#39;s mining history and which ended without a real resolution. Chuquicamata, a century-old pit which is being expanded underground, produced 302 000 t of copper last year, out of world No 2 copper miner Codelco&#39;s 1.8-million tonnes total.
