JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Improved mining productivity contributed to a 31% year-on-year increase in the Sishen mine&rsquo;s output for the quarter ended March 31, to 7.7-million tonnes. &ldquo;Production, however, decreased 10% [year-on-year] as the fourth quarter of 2016 benefitted from greater access to low strip ratio ore. Waste removal of 34-million tonnes was hampered by higher-than-expected rainfall during the first quarter; however, mining rates improved in the latter part of the quarter,&rdquo; Kumba Iron Ore said in a statement on Monday. Kumba&rsquo;s overall production for the quarter was up 17% to 10.47-million tonnes, compared with 8.93-million tonnes in the first quarter of 2016. The Kolomela mine&rsquo;s output increased by 3% to 2.8-million tonnes, driven by higher plant throughput. Waste mined increased by 32% to 10.1-million tonnes in support of production growth and ongoing improvements in operational and mining efficiency. &ldquo;Going forward, waste removal is expected to improve to meet full-year guidance of 55-million tonnes.&rdquo; Export sales rose by 7% year-on-year to 10.1-million tonnes.
