TORONTO &ndash; Union workers at ArcelorMittal&#39;s Mont-Wright iron-ore mine in northern Quebec have ratified a new four-year contract with the steelmaker, the world&#39;s largest, the United Steelworkers union said on Thursday. The 2 000 members voted on a contract that maintains the pension plan for all employees and provides pay parity for workers at the company&#39;s smaller, nearby Fire Lake mine, the union said. Last week, the union gave a 72-hour strike notice after rejecting the company&#39;s offer over concerns about wages, pensions, sub-contracting and pay disparity. Union workers operate the large open pit Mont-Wright mine, in Quebec, a railroad link to port, a processing plant in Port Cartier and Fire Lake mine. Last year, Mont-Wright produced some 27-million tonnes of iron-ore at a cash production cost of $25/t. In 2013, ArcelorMittal sold a 15% stake in Mont-Wright to South Korean steelmaker Posco and Taiwan-listed China Steel Corp for $1.1-billion.
