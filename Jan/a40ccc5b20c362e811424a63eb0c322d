VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold streaming and royalty firm Sandstorm Gold has sold ten-million common shares, or 18.2% of Africa-focused junior explorer Pinecrest Resources, raising gross proceeds of C$21-million. The transaction reduces Sandstorm&rsquo;s holdings in Pinecrest to zero. However, Sandstorm retains ten-million share purchase warrants of Pinecrest, which if exercised, would result in Sandstorm holding 13.9% of the then issued and outstanding Pinecrest shares, on a partially diluted basis. Pinecrest is a Vancouver-based explorer that is conducting mineral exploration and development of its 100% owned Enchi gold project, in Ghana. Pinecrest has recently raised C$1.5-million, which it will put to work on achieving its goals at Enchi. Sandstorm and Pinecrest entered into a strategic alliance in 2014 to develop Enchi, which is also part owned (19.9%) by Kinross Gold, and currently holds about one-million ounces of gold in the inferred resource.
