JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Pan African Resources on Monday reported that the refurbishment of the 7 and 8 Shaft complex at its Evander mines was progressing on time and within the R40-million budget. The company, led by CEO Cobus Loots, expects the refurbishment programme to be completed on April 15. The programme entailed the replacement of the 7 Shaft pump columns support infrastructure; the replacement of a damaged section of the main pump column at the 7 shaft; the replacement of the water reticulation system between the 7 and 8 shafts; the removal of redundant shaft steelwork at the 7A and 8 shafts; and repairs to the 7 and 7A shaft bottoms. The programme also includes an assessment of all other underground infrastructure that is critical to maintaining and sustaining production. Evander Mines&rsquo; 7A shaft, which is used for rock hoisting, has also normalised hoisting speed to 13 m/s, after this was reduced to 8 m/s for repairs. During the refurbishment period, on-mine management also focused on the preparation of the Evander Mines&rsquo; underground mining areas for mining restart. Underground mining operations at Evander will restart with the hoisting of about 6 000 t of mined ore currently stored within the underground infrastructure. The processing of these tonnes will assist with the expeditious ramp-up of its underground production profile. Meanwhile, Pan African expects to complete the retrenchment of about 976 employees within the next month. The company last month announced that it had reached a retrenchment agreement with the National Union of Mineworkers for the retrenchment of 976 of the Evander Mines&#39; 2 400 employees, to reduce the underground operation&rsquo;s fixed cost base once mining restarts.
