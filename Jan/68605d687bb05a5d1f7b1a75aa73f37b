PERTH (miningweekly.com) - The Fortnum gold project, in Western Australia, has produced its first gold. Owner Westgold Resources on Thursday reported that this followed the successful commissioning of the gold plant earlier this month. The ramp-up to nameplate capacity is continuing, with all parts of the process plant and infrastructure fully commissioned and operational. The one-million-tonne-a-year gold plant at Fortnum is currently being fed from existing low-grade ore stockpiles, with underground ore production to start in the September quarter.
