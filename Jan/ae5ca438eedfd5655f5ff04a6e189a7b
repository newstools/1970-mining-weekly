PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Amani Gold has reported a maiden mineral resource of 2.3-million ounces at Kebigada, on its Giro gold project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project is estimated to host some 48.7-million tonnes of resource, grading 1.5 g/t gold, which increased to 78.6-million tonnes at 1.2 g/t gold for 3-million ounces. &ldquo;We are extremely pleased in reaching an initial milestone of 3-million ounces at 1.2 g/t gold in our maiden mineral resource for Kebigada, which confirms our belief that Kebigada and of course the greater Giro gold project, has always had potential to host multimillion ounces of gold,&rdquo; said Amani chairperson Klaus Eckhof. &ldquo;We are also confident of increasing the grade with further infill drilling, which is supported by the better grades reported in the indicated resource, where we have closer drill spacing.&rdquo; Eckhof said that Amani has now moved Kebigada to the next level as the company moved towards prefeasibility and feasibility studies, with consideration to be given to possible start of early production. There were also significant under-explored areas within the Giro project, which will require further attention and could provide for new discoveries, he added.
