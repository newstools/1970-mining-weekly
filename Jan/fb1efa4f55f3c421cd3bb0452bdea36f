PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Lithium developer Pilbara Minerals has received the first of two environmental approvals for its Pilgangoora lithium-tantalum project, in Western Australia. The ASX-listed company on Monday announced that it was granted its native vegetation clearing permit. MD and CEO Ken Brinsden said the company was now in the final stages of the environmental approvals process and, with the receipt of the mining proposal, which was expected shortly, it would clear the way for full-scale site construction activities to start. &ldquo;In an industry where the development of a major new resource project is often measured in decades rather than years, Pilbara has achieved an enormous amount in a very short period of time,&rdquo; he noted. &ldquo;In the space of 12 months, we have advanced and derisked the project through resource drill out, feasibility and now with environmental approvals nearing completion.&rdquo; The Pilgangoora project is expected to deliver 314 000 t/y of 6% spodumene concentrate and 321 000 lb/y of tantalite.
