PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Lithium developer Pilbara Minerals has successfully completed a senior secured bond issue, raising a total of $100-million to finance its Pilgangoora lithium/tantalum project, in Western Australia. The bond issue was launched in May, and was well supported by a combination of large Australian and international funds. &ldquo;We are very pleased with the response from debt investors in the book build process for this bond issue. This represents a strong endorsement of the Pilgangoora project&rsquo;s outstanding economics and credentials as one of the largest and most important new hard rock lithium and tantalum projects in the world,&rdquo; said Pilbara MD Ken Brinsden. The proceeds from the bond issue will underpin the Pilgangoora project financing package required to develop the project, with first draw-down expected in October this year. The A$234-million Pilgangoora project is expected to produce an average of 314 000 t/y of 6% spodumene concentrate and 321 000 lb/y of tantalite, over a mine life of 36 years.
