BUENOS AIRES &ndash; Argentina&#39;s environmental ministry asked a federal court to totally suspend operations at Barrick Gold&#39;s Veladero mine in San Juan province, according to a statement issued by the ministry on Friday. San Juan provincial government had already rejected a work plan from Barrick after a pipe carrying gold-bearing solution ruptured a leach pad at its Veladero mine last week. Operations at the mine have been partially suspended since then.
