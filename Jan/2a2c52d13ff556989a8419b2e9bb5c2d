JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Ferrochrome producer Eurasian Resources Group (ERG) has started mining a new chrome deposit with mineable reserves of more than three-million tonnes. Located within the site of Kazakhstan&#39;s 10th Anniversary of Independence mine, in Khromtau, the deposit is expected to produce 300 000 t/y of ore.&nbsp; ERG-owned Donskoy Ore Mining and Processing Plant has already extracted the first 3 500 t of ore. Donskoy Ore Mining and Processing Plant director Maral Bekeyev said on Wednesday that the experience gained during pilot operations at the deposit would stand the company in good stead when it developed the second-stage of the mine. The miner aims to produce at a rate of six-million tonnes a year, using the cut-and-fill technique. &ldquo;This technique is used for rock pressure control whereby mined rock is replaced with filling material. It enables safer and more efficient stopping under a stronger artificial roof.&rdquo; 10th Anniversary of Independence mine head Alexander Emrakov added that the mining technique would help to reduce waste dumping and atmospheric emissions.
