Business rights watchdog AfriBusiness will consult with its legal team to determine the way forward after State-owned Eskom reportedly refused to provide it with information on the R2-billion fine imposed on Tegeta Resources&rsquo; Optimum coal mine. Following a period of arbitration, Eskom and Tegeta in April agreed to a settlement regarding a R2.2-billion penalty claim against Optimum, which had arisen in a dispute over coal quality when Glencore was still the owner of Optimum. Eskom would, in April, not reveal details of the settlement, prompting AfriBusiness to seek more details through an application in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act. Eskom on Friday informed AfriBusiness that it would still not release this information. &nbsp; &ldquo;AfriBusiness granted an extension to Eskom whereby it had 60 days to provide the requested information, but failed to do so. It is unacceptable that State-owned companies are currently being run in such a manner,&rdquo; AfriBusiness labour and law advice unit manager Charles Castle said in a statement.
