TOKYO &ndash; Japan&#39;s Sumitomo Metal Mining Co on Tuesday said it had agreed to take a 27.75% interest in a Canadian gold mining project from Toronto-based Iamgold for $195-million. The purchase of the stake in the C&ocirc;t&eacute; Gold Project in Ontario comes as Japan&#39;s biggest gold miner looks to boost its output through acquisitions and exploration. Iamgold owns 92.5% of the project, currently in its so-called prefeasiblity study phase. Production is slated to begin in 2021, with the development expected to churn out 168 t of gold over a 17-year life. &quot;With this deal, we will make progress towards our long-term goal of boosting gold output from our equity holdings to 30 t a year,&quot; Naoyuki Tsuchida, Sumitomo Metals senior managing executive officer, told a news conference. The deal is expected to complete by the end of September. The company said the project would boost its annual gold output to nearly 18 t from 15 t now. &quot;Since this project is located in the Abitibi gold belt in eastern Canada, which is one of the world&#39;s largest gold-producing areas, there may be additional reserves, depending on future exploration,&quot; Tsuchida said. Yoshiaki Nakazato, president of Sumitomo Metal, which is also miner and smelter of copper and nickel, said last month that the firm was still willing to invest in gold mines despite the record loss it booked in the fiscal year to March 2017.
