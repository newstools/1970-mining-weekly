VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Canadian project developer Strongbow Exploration has engaged engineering firms Siltbuster Process Solutions (SPS) and Nomenca to undertake process specification and outline design works for a water treatment plant at Strongbow&#39;s South Crofty project, in Cornwall, the UK. The TSX-V-listed company reported Tuesday that it has successfully completed water treatment trials in March and has subsequently applied to the Environment Agency for a mine water discharge permit. The permit is the last required to render the project fully shovel ready. The water treatment plant will be designed to treat 25 000 m3/d of mine water and enable dewatering of the mine workings in the South Crofty project area. &quot;This is an important step in the development of our South Crofty project and will enable Strongbow to begin construction of the water treatment plant, subject to financing, as soon as we receive the discharge permit from the Environment Agency. The company expects to receive the discharge permit later this year, and commence dewatering of the mine in the first half of 2018, as planned,&rdquo; CEO Richard Williams stated in a press release. SPS was responsible for overseeing the water treatment trials at the historic South Crofty mine. Nomenca will initially be undertaking target costing and outline design works for the treatment plant, which is expected to lead into the detailed engineering and construction phases.
