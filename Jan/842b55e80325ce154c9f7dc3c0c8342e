MELBOURNE - Global aluminium maker Alcoa has restarted half the capacity at its aluminium smelter in Australia&#39;s Victoria that was crippled by a state-wide blackout six months ago. The Portland smelter has been running at a third of its 300 000 t/y capacity since a freak storm prompted the power outage in December, causing molten aluminium to solidify in the facility&#39;s potlines and freezing production. &quot;Getting to the half way point in our bid to restore the business has been a big task, but what I have seen up to now gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver the plan,&quot; Plant Manager Peter Chellis said in a statement. The plant&#39;s resumption has come in part due to a A$240-million ($182-million) government-sponsored rescue package that has secured its future for at least four years in a state that has suffered from a spate of job losses including the shutdown of three major car makers and a power station. With local power costs soaring, a cheap source of energy was also needed. The Portland smelter lined up a four-year power supply deal with AGL Energy for 510 megawatts, or about 10% of the state&#39;s electricity load, earlier this year. &quot;We are expecting to have production restored to pre-outage levels by early to mid-August,&quot; Alcoa spokeswoman Jodie Read told Reuters. The government&#39;s financial aid is dependent on the smelter staying open at least until 2021 and output remaining at least 90% of pre-blackout levels. The plant is co-owned by Alcoa, Australian firm Alumina Ltd , China&#39;s CITIC Resources and an arm of Japan&#39;s Marubeni Corp.
