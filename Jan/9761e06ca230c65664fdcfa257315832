PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Phosphate producer Avenira has reported a 150% increase in the indicated mineral resource at the Gadde Bissik East deposit, at the Baobab project, in Senegal. The Gadde Bissik East deposit is now estimated to host some 31.7-million tonnes of indicated mineral resource, grading 20.6% phosphorus pentoxide, while the inferred mineral resource is estimated at 56-million tonnes, at 19% phosphorus pentoxide. A maiden inferred mineral resource estimate for three new prospects has also been released, taking the global Baobab inferred resource estimate to 114-million tonnes, at 19% phosphorus pentoxide. &ldquo;The results show continuing success for our exploration team in growing the resource base at Baobab. The resource defined to date and the demonstrated further prospectivity of our concessions, are most encouraging,&rdquo; said Avenira chairperson Dr Chris Pointon. &ldquo;They represent a major step in underpinning the medium- and longer-term growth of Avenira in Senegal.&rdquo; The Baobab project is set to produce 500 000 t/y of phosphate concentrate. Under close geological supervision, phosphate mineralisation has already been uncovered on the western side of the Stage 1 openpit. Avenira previously said the commissioning and ramp-up of the project was continuing, with the first phosphate shipment expected in the first quarter of this year.
