JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Stratex International on Tuesday reported that Thani Stratex, in which it has a 30.1% stake, has identified high-grade intercepts at its Pandora epithermal gold project, in Djibouti, during a maiden drilling programme.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 15-hole scout diamond drilling programme was undertaken at Pandora in May. The 2 159 m programme focused on the Pandora south and Pandora central zones, covering a total strike length of 1.2 km, which form part of a 10 km mapped system of epithermal veins. The aim of the drilling programme was to define the width and grade of the gold mineralisation and to confirm its depth continuity. True widths are estimated to be between 42% and 71% of the reported intersection length. &quot;The initial drilling results reported for Pandora are exciting and confirm our confidence in the prospectivity of this project,&rdquo; Stratex International CEO Marcus Engelbrecht said.
