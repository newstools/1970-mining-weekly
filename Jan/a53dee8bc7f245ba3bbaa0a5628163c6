SYDNEY - Proposals by activist investor Elliott Management to boost shareholder returns at BHP Billiton would be &quot;credit negative&quot; for the global miner, ratings agency Moody&#39;s said on Wednesday. BHP has rejected the proposals to collapse its dual-listed share structure, spin off its US petroleum business and conduct an ongoing, off-market share buyback program. Moody&#39;s on Wednesday upgraded BHP&#39;s outlook to &quot;positive&quot; from &quot;stable&quot;, saying it believes the company will continue to generate strong earnings and free cash flow in the current commodity price environment. &quot;However, the positive outlook is predicated on the group continuing with its current operating strategy and financial policies, and that its operating footprint will not change materially as a result of the Elliott proposals,&quot; Moody&#39;s said. &quot;Any material change that resulted in higher than expected shareholder returns and/or leverage would be seen as credit negative,&quot; it said. Elliott Management representatives are in Australia this week to meet BHP shareholders over the proposals. In the past year, Elliott has built up a 4.1% stake in BHP&#39;s British arm and last month told the company that it had failed to deliver &quot;optimal&quot; value. BHP has labeled the proposals as flawed and warned would involve costs far beyond any benefits if implemented.
