PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold miner WPG Resources has reported a 27% increase in the mineral resource at its Challenger gold mine, in Western Australia, which is now estimated to host a resource of some 1.4-million tonnes, grading 7.6 g/t gold for 334 000 oz. WPG said on Thursday that the restated resource estimate resulted from a change in the underground cutoff grade from 5 g/t gold to 3 g/t gold, positive drilling results and mining depletion. However, the upgraded resource ignored the results of the Challenger Deeps exploration drilling programme undertaken earlier this year, a well as exploration targets for two shoots. Chairperson Bob Duffin told shareholders that the project&rsquo;s structure gave WPG considerable encouragement that its intensive focus on underground exploration had the potential to deliver further increases in the resource inventory, as well as the mine life.
