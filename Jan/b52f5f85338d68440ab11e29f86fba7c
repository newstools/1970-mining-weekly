VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Canada&rsquo;s largest diversified miner, Teck Resources, has advised the market that it continues to mine areas unaffected by flooding at its Highland Valley Copper operations, in British Columbia, after unusual spring weather conditions and rapid snow melt resulted in water inflow into the Lornex and Valley pits. Mill operations also continue without interruption, despite mining being temporarily suspended in the affected areas. The miner reported on Sunday night that it was assessing the potential impact on production and that it was examining options to enhance dewatering. The assessment is expected to take several days. Teck also reported that the operation&rsquo;s tailings management facilities have not been impacted by the flooding in the region. During the three months ended March 31, Teck&rsquo;s copper business unit recorded about 20% lower sales than in the comparable quarter of 2016, mainly owing to lower output from Highland Valley Copper as the mine is currently in a phase of lower grade ore, as expected in the mine plan. Copper output was significantly reduced in the first quarter at 16 400 t, or 47% lower than a year ago. This was mainly owing to lower grades and recoveries as a higher-grade phase of the Valley pit was exhausted in 2016 and significantly more lower grade ore from the Lornex pit was processed than in the same period last year. Mill throughput was 9% higher, which partially offset the grade decline. Grades are expected to gradually improve as the year progresses. Molybdenum output for the quarter totalled 1.6-million pounds, 77% than a year ago owing to higher grades.
