JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; &nbsp;Diversified development company Bushveld Minerals on Thursday took another step towards the creation of an integrated vanadium platform with the signing by&nbsp;Bushveld Vametco of the final financing agreements for the completion of the acquisition of 78.8% of Strategic Minerals Corporation (SMC) from Evraz. The financial close has been concluded with Barak Fund SPC, with the financing including an $11-million bridge loan facility repayable within two months of drawdown and attracting $939 077 in interest, fees and legal charges.&nbsp; The London Aim-listed Bushveld Minerals, headed by CEO Fortune Mojapelo, has a portfolio of vanadium, iron-ore, tin and coal greenfield assets in South Africa and Madagascar. The company&rsquo;s developing integrated vanadium platform includes the Mokopane vanadium project and the Brits vanadium project in South Africa. &nbsp; A six-month, $7-million-maximum inventory financing facility to Strategic Minerals Corporation subsidiary Evraz Vametco Alloys facilitates the monetisation of Bushveld&rsquo;s proprietary Nitrovan vanadium inventory, providing additional cash resources that would otherwise have been received only after delivery completion to customers.&nbsp; On completion of the acquisition, Bushveld Vametco intends refinancing the bridge loan without the need for an equity issue.&nbsp; Barak&rsquo;s financing, together with the Wogen Resources&#39; financing, sales and marketing agreement of March 20, provides Bushveld Vametco with up to $13-million in working capital, made up of the $7-million inventory facility and Wogen&rsquo;s $6-million financing for ongoing production, the company outlined in a release to Creamer Media&rsquo;s Mining Weekly Online. Security provided by Bushveld Vametco for Barak financing includes a charge over SMC shares, the cession of dividends owed from SMC to Bushveld Vametco and a guarantee of Bushveld Vametco&rsquo;s payment obligations under the bridge loan from&nbsp;Bushveld, Yellow Dragon and Bushveld Vametco itself. Meraki Capital advised Bushveld on the Barak financing.
