PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior graphite developer Kibaran Resources has reported a 40% increase in the mineral resource at its Epanko project, in Tanzania. The company on Friday reported that the mineral resource was now estimated at 30.7-million tonnes, grading 9.9% total graphitic grade for 3.05-million tonnes of contained graphite. The upgraded mineral resource incorporated infill and extensional drilling completed in 2016, and geotechnical inputs generated as part of the updated base case bankable feasibility study (BFS) of 40 000 t/y over a 25-year life-of-mine, including a 60 000 t/y scenario. Kibaran noted that a revised mine plan and ore reserve, for both the 40 000 t/y and 60 000 t/y concentrate scenarios, will be completed and incorporated in the updated BFS in April.
