LIMA &ndash; A Southern Copper spokesperson said operations in Peru were near normal as workers started an indefinite strike on Monday, although a union representative said 80% of capacity was affected. The Cuajone and Toquepala copper mines were producing at 98% and the Ilo refinery was operating at 100% capacity, the Southern Copper spokesperson said. The strike follows labour disruptions at Peru&#39;s biggest copper mine, Cerro Verde, and Chile&#39;s Escondida, the world&#39;s largest copper mine, earlier this year. Southern Copper, owned by Grupo Mexico, boosted its copper output by 21% to 900 000 t last year on the back of an expansion at a mine in Mexico. Jose Espejo, a member of a union representing 2 200 workers, said workers had walked off the job and started protesting early on Monday to demand a greater share of company profits. &quot;We are based on each side of the railroad and we will not let the train pass,&quot; he said, referring to the railway that transports copper concentrates from Cuajone and Toquepala to the Ilo refinery. Another union of 800 workers at Toquepala plans to join the strike on Wednesday, Espejo said. The company spokesperson said union members would meet later on Monday with company representatives to try to resolve the conflict.
