PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Buru Energy has restarted oil production from its Ungani oilfield, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Production at Ungani was suspended in January 2016, following the deterioration of the oil price. &ldquo;We are delighted to be able to report that we are back in production. The small and dedicated Buru team have done a great job to deliver the restart on time and on budget,&rdquo; said Buru executive chairperson Eric Streitberg. During the next week, a series of reservoir performance test, including interference test and shut-in and build-up periods will be carried out to gather reservoir information on the field. Oil will be produced into the onsite storage tanks during this phase, and the first truck loading to the Wyndham Port is expected late next week, Streitbeg said. &ldquo;After the reservoir data acquisition programme is completed, we will be looking to increase production to a steady 1 250 barrels a day while we work on the next phase of development of the field,&rdquo; he added.
