PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mineral sands developer Sheffield Resources has signed another memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the future sale of zircon from its Thunderbird project, in Western Australia. The nonbinding MoU with India&rsquo;s Sukaso Ceracolors represented up to 20% of the estimated total volume of zircon to be produced from Stage 1 of the Thunderbird operation, Sheffield said on Monday. Sheffield earlier this month inked two nonbinding offtake MoUs representing a combined 20% of the estimated Stage 1 zircon production from Thunderbird. The A$271-million Stage 1 development is expected to have an 8.5-million-tonne-a-year throughput, doubling to 17-million tonnes a year in the fifth year of operations, with the investment of a further A$195-million. Over its 42-year mine life, Thunderbird is expected to deliver some 76 100 t/y of premium zircon, 68 500 t/y of zircon concentrate, 387 800 t/y of ilmenite and 229 800 t/y of titano-magnetite. Sheffield MD Bruce McFadzean said that the relationship with Sukaso was a welcome one. &ldquo;Establishment of these important relationships speak volumes for the scale and quality of Thunderbird across the expected 42-year life of mine. Consumers are clearly positioning themselves to identify potential long-term sources of supply for premium zircon product, and the MoU signed with Sukaso confirms Thunderbird&rsquo;s capability and unique market position as a future source of very high quality products.&rdquo;
