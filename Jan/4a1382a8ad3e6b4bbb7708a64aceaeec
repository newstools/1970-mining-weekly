MOSCOW &ndash; Russia&#39;s Rosneft, the world&#39;s top listed oil company by output, will continue to work in Venezuela and will never leave the country, its CEO Igor Sechin told reporters on Wednesday. &quot;We will never leave Venezuela,&quot; Sechin said. Rosneft has a number of tight oil projects in Venezuela, which is in the grips of an economic and political crisis. Rosneft has lent its Venezuelan counterpart PDVSA between $4-billion and $5-billion in recent years, according to Reuters calculations. The Russian firm has been gaining ground in Venezuela as the cash-strapped leftist government scrambles for cash.
