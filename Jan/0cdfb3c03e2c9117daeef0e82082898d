PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Bulk earthworks have started at the Pilgangoora lithium project, in Western Australia, following the receipt of statutory approvals. ASX-listed Altura Mining on Tuesday said the start of on-site work brought the company closer to unlocking significant strong cash flows in early 2018 through the sale of spodumene concentrate from Pilgangoora. A previously completed definitive feasibility study estimated that the project will have a yearly ore feed rate of 1.54-million tonnes to deliver 219 000 t/y of spodumene concentrate containing 6% lithium, with estimated life-of-mine cash costs of A$316/t of spodumene concentrate. The project will cost an estimated A$139.7-million to develop.
