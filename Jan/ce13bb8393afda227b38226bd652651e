JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diamond giant De Beers&rsquo; International Institute of Diamond Grading and Research (IIDGR) subsidiary on Tuesday unveiled a synthetic screening device to test multiple stones in set jewellery at once without the need for a probe. Synthdetect, which also has a low referral rate of around 0.05%, uses the group&rsquo;s patented luminescence technology to rapidly and simultaneously screen stones set in jewellery pieces, including rings, earrings, bangles, broaches and necklaces. &ldquo;The very low referral rate dramatically reduces the need for additional and potentially costly testing compared with many other synthetic screening products which can have referral rates approaching 10%,&rdquo; IIDGR president Jonathan Kendall said in a statement. The technology had been specifically designed for back office use to support jewellery manufacturers and retailers to &ldquo;quickly, easily and reliably&rdquo; ensure the authenticity of the diamonds they buy. The first deliveries of Synthdetect devices are expected to be made in September.
