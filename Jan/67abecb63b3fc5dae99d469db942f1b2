JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Spanish copper miner Atalaya Mining produced 8 805 t of copper in concentrate in the first quarter of 2017, which is in line with its output of the previous quarter. The company is one of Europe&rsquo;s newest copper producers and operates the Proyecto Riotinto openpit mine, where commercial production was declared in February 2016. The miner processed 2.2-million tonnes of ore in the first three months of 2017. This compares with 2-million tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 4 048 t in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue increased from &euro;4.9-million in the first quarter of 2016 to &euro;25.6-million in the period under review, resulting in Atalaya posting profit of &euro;5.2-million, compared with a loss of &euro;3.3-million in the prior-year period. &quot;The first quarter of 2017 was strong both financially and operationally as Proyecto Riotinto continues to perform well.&nbsp; The combination of falling operating costs and improved levels of production and recovery reflect our ongoing on-site efficiencies,&rdquo; CEO Alberto Lavandeira commented in a statement. Atalaya&rsquo;s copper production guidance for 2017 is 34 000 t to 40 000 t. Meanwhile, permitting was initiated at Proyecto Touro, in north-west Spain, and Lavandeira said that the company was progressing its in-fill and step-out drilling programmes. Atalaya exercised its option to acquire an initial 10% stake in Proyecto Touro in February, based on a staged earn-in process to acquire 80% of the brownfield copper project. &ldquo;In an environment of declining new global copper supply, Atalaya continues to advance its projects and remains a long term option on the copper price,&rdquo; he said.
