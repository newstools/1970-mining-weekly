JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; An increase in the average dollar prices of most of the commodities it produces has contributed to an estimated 272% to 288% year-on-year increase in JSE-listed African Rainbow Minerals&rsquo; (ARM&rsquo;) headline earnings a share for the six months ended December 31. This translates to headline earnings a share of between 867c and 903c for the period, based on weighted average number of shares in issue of 189-million. Headline earnings reported for the comparative period of 2015, were R507-million, or 233c a share. Most operations, except the Goedgevonden coal mine and Nkomati nickel mine, also achieved below-inflation unit cost increases. For this reason, the company noted that its basic earnings would be negatively impacted. &ldquo;This is mainly attributable to an impairment of the Nkomati assets of R711-million after tax, an attributable impairment of the Modikwa platinum mine assets of R734-million after tax and noncontrolling interest and an attributable impairment loss on investment of R422-million within the Assmang joint venture related to the sale of Dwarsrivier,&rdquo; the company noted. However, ARM still expects to narrow its basic loss a share by between 69% and 75% to between 115c and 140c. The basic loss reported for the comparable period was R996-million, while the basic loss a share was 458c. ARM will release its interim financial results on March 16.
