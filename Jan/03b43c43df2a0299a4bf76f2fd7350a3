VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Precious metals producer McEwen Mining has reported a profit for 2016 of $21.1-million, or $0.07 a share, compared with a net loss of $20.5-million, or $0.07 a share in 2015. The Colorado-incorporated miner, which operates the El Gallo mine, in Mexico, and has a 49% interest in the San Jos&eacute; mine, in Argentina, said Wednesday improved result was attributable to the strong financial performance achieved at both its mines. Net cash provided by operations for 2016 increased to $25.2-million, compared with $15.6-million in 2015. For 2016, San Jos&eacute; mine contributed $17.7-million in dividends to operating cash flows, compared with $500 000 in 2015; and the&nbsp; El Gallo mine contributed $59.5-million in gold and silver sales to operating cash flow, compared with $70.2-million in 2015. Consolidated gold equivalent output in 2016, at a silver-to-gold ratio of 75:1, totalled 145 530 oz, comprising 90 264 gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) attributable to the company from San Jos&eacute; mine, and 55 266 GEOs from the El Gallo mine. Consolidated gold equivalent ounces sold totalled 144 048 oz, comprising 48 902 GEOs from El Gallo mine and 95 146 attributable GEOs from San Jos&eacute;. Revenue fell 17% year-over-year to $60.39-million. As of February 27, McEwen held cash, investments, and precious metals valued at spot prices of $55.2-million, with no debt. The company plans to produce 50 000 oz of gold and 3.3-million ounces of silver from the San Jos&eacute; mine this year, and 49 700 oz of gold and 24 000 ounces of silver from the El Gallo mine. This represents exected consolidated output of 144 000 GEOs, just short of the 2016 total. For 2017, total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs at the El Gallo mine are forecast to be $760/GEO and $900/GEO, respectively, which is higher than the 2016 totals of $524/GEO and $610/GEO; and total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs at the San Jos&eacute; mine are forecast at $780/GEO and $990/GEO, respectively, up from $760/GEO and $954/GEO during 2016.
