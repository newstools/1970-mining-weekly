JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Anglo American has appointed Ian Ashby as a nonexecutive director, effective July 25. With 37 years of experience in the mining industry, including 25 years in a variety of roles with BHP Billiton, ultimately leading the company&rsquo;s iron-ore business, Anglo American chairperson John Parker noted that Ashby&rsquo;s leadership in major new mining projects and his depth of operational and commercial experience across numerous commodities and mining jurisdictions would further enrich board discussions.

He began his career as an underground miner at the Mount Isa Mines base metals operations, in Queensland, Australia.
