PERTH (miningweekly.com)- Nickel miner Western Areas has reported a 311% increase in the total massive sulphide resource at its Cosmos Odysseus project, in Western Australia, increasing it to 22 838 t grading 8.4% nickel. An increase in the Odysseus North disseminated indicated resource, and an overall increase to the inferred disseminated resource has seen the project&rsquo;s total mineral resource now estimated at 7.9-million tonnes, grading 2.5% nickel for 199 174 t of nickel. Western Areas MD Dan Lougher said on Friday that the increase in the confidence level of the resource at Odysseus was one of the critical path items for the&nbsp; completion of the project&rsquo;s definitive feasibility study, and would support the definition of an ore reserve for the project. &ldquo;The amount of massive sulphides included from limited drilling and the increase in total nickel tonnes was above our expectation when we completed due diligence on this acquisition,&rdquo; Lougher told shareholders. A recently completed prefeasibility study estimated that the Odysseus project could deliver an average of 12 000 t/y of nickel in concentrate over an initial mine life of seven years, and would require a capital expenditure of between A$190-million and A$210-million. Lougher on Friday also announced that work on the definitive feasibility study has now started, with Piran Mining appointed as project manager.
