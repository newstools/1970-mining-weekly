JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Highland Gold has set aside $1-million for preliminary prospecting work at two greenfield sites adjacent to the existing licence areas for the Mnogovershinnoye mine (MNV), in Russia&rsquo;s Far Eastern district. Potential mineralisation was previously identified in both of the licence areas, suggesting that they may represent continuations of MNV&#39;s geological structure. The Zamanchivaya licence, which covers 4.2 km2, is located directly adjacent to the Pebble ore body, one of MNV&#39;s existing openpits. The Kulibinskaya licence area, covers 38 km2 and is located to the south-west of MNV. The Jersey-headquartered company said on Monday that it would spend $200 000 on exploratory drilling, which would assist it in developing more detailed expansion plans for next year. These licences are valid for seven years.
