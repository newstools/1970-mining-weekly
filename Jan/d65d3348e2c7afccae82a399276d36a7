JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; German fertiliser group WITTRACO D&uuml;ngmittel has expressed an interest in buying one fifth of Australian potash developer Kalium Lake&rsquo;s sulphate of potash (SOP) production from its Beyondie SOP project, in Western Australia. Kalium has signed a nonbinding offtake memorandum of understanding with WITTRACO for 20% of the project&rsquo;s yearly SOP production during the first five years of production. The ASX-listed project developer said in a statement on Friday that the German group planned to support the development of the Beyondie SOP project and that the companies planned to concert the MoU to a binding sales contract. The Beyondie SOP project, near Newman, comprises 15 granted exploration licences and a miscellaneous licence covering about 2 400 km2. The project has an inferred mineral resource of 18.84-million tonnes and an indicated mineral resource of 0.94-million tonnes drainable brine SOP. Kallium also recently entered into a joint venture with BC Iron over the Carnegie project, near Wiluna.
