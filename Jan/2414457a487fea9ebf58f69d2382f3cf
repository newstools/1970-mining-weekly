DAR ES SALAAM &ndash; Tanzania&#39;s president fired the mining minister and the chief of the State-run mineral audit agency on Wednesday, after receiving a report into whether mining companies were under-declaring the value of their exports. President John Magufuli&#39;s decision, announced in a speech, signals an escalation of tensions between the government and the industry, which has denied engaging in tax evasion. Mining accounts for about 4% of Tanzania&#39;s gross domestic product.
