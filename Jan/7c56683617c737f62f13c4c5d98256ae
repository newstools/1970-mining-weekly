JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mineral and exploration development company Beowulf is not giving up on its planned Kallak magnetite iron-ore project near Jokkmokk, in Swedish Lapland, despite delays in being granted an exploitation concession, the company&rsquo;s CEO said on Friday. Kurt Budge said he found it &ldquo;impossible to comprehend&rdquo; that Beowulf was still waiting to restart investing in Kallak, to initiate a scoping study and to drill the Kallak South exploration target, which will significantly boost the Kallak resource and where local partnerships will be formed to deliver a modern mining operation. &quot;Jokkmokk is looking for investors who want to build businesses. We have invested over kr72-million in Kallak to date; however, despite authorities stating our application meets the requirements, and that our project could deliver significant economic benefits, we continue to face delays in being awarded an exploitation concession.&rdquo; Budge said Beowulf was encouraged by the support from stakeholders that see mining as part of the future for the town of Jokkmokk. In the meantime, Beowulf is advancing plans for the Kallak project. The company recently raised &pound;1.5-million, part of which will be used for a scoping study on the project. Last month, Beowulf also presented an analysis of the indirect effects of a mining operation at Kallak on Laponia with respect to reindeer herding, and the effects of transport on Laponia. The analysis, which followed United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation guidelines, highlighted that a mining operation at Kallak will have no direct impact on Laponia.
