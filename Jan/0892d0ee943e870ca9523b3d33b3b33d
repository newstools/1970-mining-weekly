PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior Thor Mining has reported a 55% increase in the tungsten resource at its Pilot Mountain project, in Nevada, following recent drilling. The ASX-listed company said on Monday that a maiden resource of 1.83-million tonnes, at an average grade of 0.36% tungsten trioxide has been declared for the Garnet deposit, while a re-evaluation of the Desert Scheelite deposit resulted in an upgrade to the resource estimate to 9.9-million tonnes, at an average grade of 0.26% tungsten trioxide. The resource upgrades have increased Pilot Mountain&rsquo;s total resource estimate to 11.73-million tonnes, grading 0.28% tungsten trioxide. Thor executive chairperson Mick Billing pointed out that the project&rsquo;s resource inventory still had considerable growth potential via the GunMetal and Good Hope deposits, as well as more potential upside at both Garnet and Desert Scheelite.
