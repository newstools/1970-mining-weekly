JAKARTA - Operations at the world&#39;s No.2 copper mine in Indonesia are &quot;running as normal&quot;, a spokesman for the local unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc said, despite thousands of workers extending a strike for another month. Riza Pratama said in a text message on Thursday that &quot;around 25 000 workers and contractors&quot; continued to work at the Grasberg mine, a key supplier to buyers including top metals consumer China. That came after Freeport Indonesia union industrial relations officer Tri Puspital told Reuters on Wednesday that 6 000 workers would remain on strike. Workers started their strike in May after Freeport laid off around 10% of its 32 000 workforce while it negotiates a new mining permit with the government. Freeport resumed exports of copper concentrate in April after a 15-week outage related to the negotiations with Jakarta. Earlier this month, Freeport&#39;s chief financial officer said the company was on track to reach an agreement with the government.
