JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Great Western Exploration has signed a farm-in agreement with Sandfire Resources to explore the company&rsquo;s northern Yerrida copper tenements. Through the agreement, Sandfire will farm into 11 of the company&rsquo;s exploration licences, totalling 1 560 km2. Sandfire will earn an initial 70% interest in the company&rsquo;s northern Yerrida tenements by paying $500 000 in shares, committing to a minimum exploration spend of $1.7-million and sole funding exploration until the delineation of 50 000 t or more of in-ground copper resources. Great Western MD Jordan Luckett said the agreement offered a clear pathway to production if a discovery was made. Sandfire will solely fund exploration expenditure on the tenements to define a mineral resource of 50 000 t of contained copper or copper equivalent, with a second earn-in for 80% interest being achieved by Sandfire&rsquo;s sole funding the completion of a feasibility study. Both companies have pre-emptive rights to the other party&rsquo;s interest where an interest has been offered for sale to a third party. Luckett added that the agreement would enable one of Australia&rsquo;s &ldquo;most successful exploration teams&rdquo; to explore the northern Yerrida area with the considerable knowledge, understanding and experience gained through the nearby discoveries of De Grussa and Monty. &ldquo;The opportunity to develop a long-term partnership with Sandfire may also prove invaluable if we make a discovery on our 100%-owned southern Yerrida areas, which the company considers to be equally prospective for volcanogenic massive sulphide and sedimentary hosted copper/cobalt,&rdquo; he said. If Sandfire wishes to withdraw prior to meeting the minimum expenditure, it is obligated to pay a cash consideration equal to the minimum expenditure amount, less the actual expenditure made on the tenements.
