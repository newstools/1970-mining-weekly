JOHANNESBURG &ndash; South Africa&#39;s new mining charter, which sets industry targets for black ownership and participation in the sector, will be gazetted and become law next week, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane said on Tuesday. The mining industry has complained that it has not been consulted enough about the revisions and that South Africa&#39;s mining industry is losing investment as a result.
