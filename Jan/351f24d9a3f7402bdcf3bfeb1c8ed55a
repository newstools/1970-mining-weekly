JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Initial testwork at Armadale&rsquo;s Mahenge Liandu graphite project, in Tanzania, continue sto indicate that it is capable of producing high-quality graphite concentrates, with possible expansion up to 480 cm&sup3;/g. The Aim-listed company said the results further increase the range of potential commercial applications for the graphite, including the highly prospective battery market. The project currently has a high-grade Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant inferred mineral resource estimate of 40.9-million tonnes at 9.41% total graphitic content (TGC), of which at least 32-million tonnes has an average grade of 10.47% TGC.&nbsp; Armadale is now preparing to start its 2 500 m diamond and reverse circulation drill programme in early May, with the aim to expand the size of the resource and enhance the category to indicated.
