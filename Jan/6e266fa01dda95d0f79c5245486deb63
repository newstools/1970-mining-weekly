JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diamond giant De Beers achieved a marginal increase in sales in the third sales cycle of this year to $580-million, from the $545-million in sales in the second sales cycle. &ldquo;We saw the continuation of good rough diamond demand in the third cycle across the product range. This reflected positive sentiment from our customers following the Hong Kong International Jewellery Show in March,&rdquo; CEO Bruce Cleaver said. However, this was still markedly lower than the $729-million achieved in the first sales cycle of this year as well as the $666-million it raked in in the third sales cycle last year.
