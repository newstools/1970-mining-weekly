PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; US coal major Peabody Energy has reported a 29% increase in revenue for the first quarter ended March, driven by an increase in production in the US and Australia. Revenue for the first quarter increased from $1.03-billion to $1.33-billion, driven by a 26% increase in Powder River Basin shipments, a 17% rise in Western sales volumes, and a 139% and 44% average revenue-a-tonne increases in Australian metallurgical and thermal coal, respectively. &ldquo;Peabody&#39;s first-quarter results were significantly improved over the prior year across the platform, reflecting sharply higher coal demand in the US and expanded Australian margins for both thermal and metallurgical coal,&rdquo; Peabody president and CEO Glenn Kellow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s said in a statement on Thursday. First-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, and restructuring or rent costs (Ebitdar) rose to $390-million, a $304.9-million increase over the first quarter of 2016.&nbsp; Adjusted Ebitdar included about $30-million in negative first-quarter impacts from Cyclone Debbie, in Australia, and a $20-million benefit associated with the sale of the company&#39;s 37.5% interest in the Dominion Terminal Associates, in Virginia, as part of the company&#39;s ongoing portfolio management process. &ldquo;While several temporary issues in Australia prevented the quarter from meeting our full potential, our performance was greatly improved with excellent cash generation from our operations,&rdquo; said Kellow. &ldquo;We look forward to advancing with a strengthened balance sheet, rebounding shipments in Queensland, and retention of the Metropolitan mine, in New South Wales.&rdquo; The company is retaining the Metropolitan hard coking coal mine and its associated 16.67% interest in Port Kembla coal terminal, after diversified miner South32 was unable to obtain regulatory clearance for the $200-million transaction, and terminated the purchase contract last month. Looking ahead at the full year, Peabody expects to produce between 145-million and 155-million tonnes of coal from its US assets, and between 32-million and 34-million tonnes from its Australian projects.
