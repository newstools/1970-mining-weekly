PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Graphite developer Walkabout Resources has been granted environmental approval for its Lindi jumbo graphite mine, in Tanzania. The award of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) certificate was a prerequisite to the mining licence application, which will now be submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, Walkabout said on Tuesday. The company expects to be granted a mining licence in the third quarter of this year. &ldquo;The awarding of the EIA is a major milestone in moving towards a mining licence and to attracting development funding,&rdquo; said Walkabout executive chairperson Trevor Benson. &ldquo;The project can now progress along its planned development pathway in parallel with ongoing negotiations with potential offtake partners and securing development capital.&rdquo; A definitive feasibility study into the Lindi project estimated the project will cost $38.7-million to support production of 40 000 t/y of graphite concentrate over a 20-year period. The project is expected to generate a life-of-mine revenue of some $1.25-billion and average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $47.7-million, with the pretax net present value estimated at $323-million and the pretax internal rate of return estimated at 96.4%.
