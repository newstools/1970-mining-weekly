VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; One of the co-founders of Canadian base metals producer First Quantum Minerals Martin Rowley will retire on June 30. He co-founded the company with Philip Pascall and Clive Newall in 1996, and served as CFO&nbsp; and director until 2007, when he assumed the role of executive director for business development. Significant milestones under his watch included the acquisition and development of Africa&#39;s largest copper mine, the Kansanshi mine, in Zambia, and the takeover of Inmet and its tier-one Cobre Panama copper project, in Panama. &quot;It is a difficult decision to retire as an executive at this stage of exciting development and growth of the company, but after over 20 years in executive roles I am confident that with the energy and culture of First Quantum&#39;s people, succession will be seamless and the business strategy will continue to be successful as it has to date,&rdquo; Rowley reminisced. &quot;One of the most satisfying elements of the First Quantum journey has been the benefits that have flowed to the communities in which we operate our mines throughout the world.&quot;
