JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Since bottoming out in early 2016 and staging an impressive, albeit largely speculative, rally over the past year-and-a-half, industrial metals will experience a gradual price recovery over the coming years, as improving fundamentals support a stabilisation, rather than rebound, in prices, research firm BMI said on Friday. The traditional bellwether metal, copper, was expected to most closely follow this narrative, with BMI forecasting a 12.9% year-on-year price increase for this year. Meanwhile, BMI noted that steel and iron-ore prices would remain relatively weaker, as years of oversupply and slowing Chinese consumption growth provided limited upside pressure. &ldquo;Although steel prices will return to a modest uptrend beyond 2018, the global long-term outlook for steel demand remains comparatively downbeat, as rising efficiency reduces overall consumption and the acceleration of Chinese economic rebalancing limits upside potential,&rdquo; it pointed out. On the other hand, while zinc&#39;s outperformance is no surprise, given the constrained ore supply, tin and lead prices will also prove particularly resilient. &ldquo;We forecast tin and lead prices to increase by an average of 4.7% and 4.3% yearly over 2017 to 2021, respectively.&rdquo; The global tin market is expected to experience significant tightening over the coming years, on both the supply and demand side, posting the largest decline in stock-to-use ratio from 15.5% in 2016 to 6% by 2021. &ldquo;Specifically, tin&#39;s versatility and use in multiple sectors, such as electronics manufacturing and chemicals, will sustain demand for the metal over a multidecade horizon, while depleting ore reserves and a sparse global project pipeline will curb tin supply,&rdquo; BMI said. BMI further pointed out that it expected lead prices to rise and average above-consensus at $2 300/t by 2021, as the global market deficit widens further, reflected in the low stock-to-use ratio forecast of 3.1% by 2021. Deficits will be due to stagnating production growth from major producers and more resilient consumption growth, driven by the automotive sectors in key markets, such as India and China.
