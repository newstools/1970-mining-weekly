TORONTO &ndash; Unionised workers at ArcelorMittal&#39;s Mont-Wright iron-ore mine in northern Quebec gave the steelmaker, the world&#39;s largest, a 72-hour strike notice after rejecting the company&#39;s contract offer, the United Steelworkers union said on Friday. Some 2 000 union members, who work at the large open pit mine, its railroad link to port and a processing plant in Port Cartier, have voted to strike if a new collective agreement is not reached in 72 hours, the union said in a statement. A proposed two-tier pension system would hurt new workers, said union coordination Nicolas Lapierre in a press release. The union also wants ArcelorMittal to return some contracted-out positions to unionised jobs and resolve discrepancies in working conditions between ArcelorMittal&rsquo;s Mont-Wright mine and its Fire Lake mine. ArcelorMittal was not immediately available for comment.
