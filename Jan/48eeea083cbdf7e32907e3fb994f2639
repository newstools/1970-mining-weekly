JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Botswana Diamonds has completed the first phase of drilling at its flagship Vutomi project, in Frischgewaagt, in South Africa, where 34 percussion and nine diamond drill holes were drilled on the kimberlite dyke. The Aim-listed company on Thursday said samples have been submitted for microdiamond analysis, with results expected within two months. Another round of drilling will be completed in April or May to identify the area for bulk sampling. Botswana Diamonds chairperson John Teeling commented that Frischgewaagt was turning into a &ldquo;very exciting&rdquo; project. &ldquo;To date, we have discovered two blows on the kimberlite dyke system and we are moving to delineate the size of each one. The drilling samples contain high quantities of diamond indicator minerals of similar profile to the highly profitable Marsfontein mine some 20 km away.&rdquo; In previous work, 467 diamonds, yielding 247 ct were recovered from the processing of surface material.&nbsp; The largest diamond was 3.66 ct, with the parcel having an average size of 0.53 ct.&nbsp; The sale of these diamonds achieved a rough diamond value of $180/ct and a modelled value of $259/ct at a bottom cutoff of +2 mm.
