SANTIAGO &ndash; Companies have stepped up their requests for engineers and other positions at early stage mining projects in Chile, a local recruiter said on Monday, in a further sign of activity warming up in the industry. Chile is the world&#39;s biggest producer of copper, which makes up over half its export earnings. The country also mines gold, molybdenum, lithium and other minerals. The global commodities slowdown has hurt Chile&#39;s economy, leading to a sharp downturn in investment and job cuts over the last three years. A return to former boom times is still distant. But there are signs of a rebound in recruitment, Pilar Cruz, senior consultant of the mining division at Michael Page Chile, said in an interview. As well as being good news for Chile&#39;s economy -- where unemployment has remained relatively low, but job quality has diminished -- that could be a sign that increased metals output is around the corner after years of belt tightening. &quot;The roles we&#39;re seeing are engineering -- feasibility, design, and environmental approval,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s a good sign that in a couple of years, the construction phases will start with different kinds of jobs and a lot more people.&quot; Available vacancies in the mining engineering sector were up between 20% and 30% from a year ago, she said. Projects hiring include Lundin Mining&#39;s Candelaria copper, gold and silver project, Codelco&#39;s expansion of its Chuquicamata mine to take it underground, a pre-feasibility study by Goldcorp and Teck Resources to join two mines into one called NuevaUnion, and Teck&#39;s Quebrada Blanca phase two, said Cruz. The lithium boom in Chile has also seen a rise in interest from larger miners looking at diversifying away from copper, she added. While still a relatively small market, lithium, used in electric car batteries, has been a rare bright spot in commodities in recent years. Salaries, however, were generally some 20% less than in former years, and that was unlikely to change any time soon, said the recruiter, as companies fight to keep a tight lid on costs. &quot;These are signals,&quot; said Cruz. &quot;I don&#39;t think the trend is short-term, it seems to be rebounding. But it won&#39;t transform overnight.&quot;
