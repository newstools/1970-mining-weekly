JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Negotiations for yearly wage increases at Johannesburg-based miner Central Rand Gold (CRG) have ended in a deadlock, with the employees embarking on a strike. The company on Wednesday said it had lost five days of production owing to the strike and that it was in talks with union officials at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to resolve issues. On Tuesday, the picketing rules were signed at the CCMA, thus allowing nonstriking workers to return to work. The operation will be run with skeleton staff in the interim. Meanwhile, the miner noted that it had received its $250 000 loan tranche from investor Jia Bang Wang. CRG in April reported that this payment had been delayed. &ldquo;[Our] cash position has been improved by the delivery of this tranche and we will continue to exercise prudence in its expenditure,&rdquo; it said in a statement.
