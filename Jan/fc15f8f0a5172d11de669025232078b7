PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) has welcomed the revival of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), saying Australia would stand to gain significant economic benefits from the regional trade agreement. Eleven Asia-Pacific countries, including Australia, over the weekend agreed to revive the free trade deal, despite a January decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the TPP. The original TPP, which took more than five years to negotiate, covers about 40% of global gross domestic product (GDP). MCA CEO Brendan Pearson said on Monday that the new TPP would deliver benefits for Australia by reducing barriers to trade in a wide range of goods and services and improving access to export markets in the Asia-Pacific. &ldquo;Australia&rsquo;s manufacturing, agriculture, resources and services industries will all gain better access to regional export markets such as Japan, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam and Peru under a revived TPP,&rdquo; Pearson said. He pointed to economic modelling that showed the TPP would boost Australian exports by A$39-billion, or 4.9%, and Australian national income by A$20-billion, or 0.6% of GDP, in 2030. &ldquo;The Trump administration&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from the TPP does not reduce these economic gains &ndash; in fact, if anything, it will increase the benefits for Australia,&rdquo; Pearson said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because Australia already has access to the US under its existing bilateral free trade agreement, while a number of other TPP member countries will not have preferential access to the US market. &ldquo;With around 2.5-million Australian jobs relying on trade, yesterday&rsquo;s decision by regional trade Ministers to explore all options for bringing the &lsquo;TPP minus one&rsquo; into force is a welcome development.&rdquo;
