JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; In what was a very tough year for the uranium mining industry, Rio Tinto subsidiary R&ouml;ssing Uranium, which operates in Namibia, swung to a profit of N$107-million in 2016, from a loss of N$385-million in 2015. In the company&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report to Shareholders 2016&rsquo;, MD Werner Duvenhage said the year was &ldquo;widely labelled the worst year of the past decade for the uranium industry&rdquo;, with the spot price having dropped by 50% between January and November. He noted that the spot price had, at one stage, hit a low of $20/lb, where the break-even cost for most uranium mines is estimated at between $40/lb and $50/lb. Duvenhage said Rio Tinto&rsquo;s marketing strategy of entering into long-term contracts with clients had played a role in minimising R&ouml;ssing&rsquo;s losses during 2016, while the 49% year-on-year increase in production to 1 850 t of uranium oxide had helped to offset the impact of lower prices on the company&rsquo;s cash flow. A favourable exchange rate had also positively impacted on net profit.
