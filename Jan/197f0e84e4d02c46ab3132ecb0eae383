JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Former Xtract Resources and Pan African Resources CEO Jan Nelson has joined Handa Copper &ndash; a TSX-V-listed company focusing on prospects in Africa &ndash; as CEO. Nelson, who quit as Aim-listed Xtract CEO in September last year, will head up the exploration company&rsquo;s new management team, which will be based in Johannesburg. Handa&rsquo;s main focus is a copper project in the Republic of Congo (RoC), which it believes is a &ldquo;highly significant&rdquo; discovery. The explorer states that geological parallels between the West Congolian belt and the Central African Copperbelt (CACB), the world&rsquo;s richest copper province, have been recognised since the 1930s, but sustained modern exploration has never been carried out on the West Congolian belt. Archival records, including more than 10 000 stream sediment and soil samples, show the potential for CACB-style copper deposits on the company&rsquo;s exploration licences in the RoC. Former CEO Marek Kreczmer, who is based in Vancouver, will remain a director of Handa. In a media statement on Monday, Nelson expressed his gratitude to Kreczmer agreeing to stay on as a board member and added that he believed the Handa management team&rsquo;s record of success in Africa and its broad exposure to equity markets in North America, Europe and Africa, would stand it in good stead to generate strong returns for its shareholders.
