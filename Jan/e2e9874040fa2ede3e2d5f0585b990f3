PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior Renascor Resources has been awarded a A$100 000 grant by the South Australian state government to support mineral processing testwork at its Siviour graphite deposit, in the Eyre Peninsula. Renascor said on Tuesday that the company would use the funds to optimise the Siviour mineral process flow sheet and to identify operational and capital cost reductions that could be applied to a full-scale operation. The grant, awarded as part of the Future Industries Accelerator, would also support testwork assessing the suitability of Siviour concentrates for advanced industry applications, including lithium-ion batteries and expandable graphite. The Siviour deposit forms part of the greater Arno graphite project, and hosts a mineral resource of some 80.6-million tonnes, at 7.9% total graphitic carbon, for 6.4-million tonnes of contained graphite. Renascor told shareholders that grant work would start immediately, with results to be incorporated into ongoing studies aimed at optimising the potential for Siviour to produce high-quality and cost-competitive graphite concentrates for sale into the traditional industrial markets and into the lithium-ion battery sector.
