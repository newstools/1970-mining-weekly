PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Metals miner MMG has started the recruitment process for its A$1.4-billion Dugald River zinc project, in Queensland, which is expected to start production in the first half of 2018. State Development and Natural Resources and Mines Minister Dr Anthony Lynham welcomed the boon for local jobs in the north. &ldquo;More than 40 positions are currently being advertised for jobs in maintenance, plant and process operators, and service crews, and these roles are essential to the next step of MMG&rsquo;s operations near Mount Isa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These jobs are just the beginning, as it is anticipated that MMG Dugald River will employ up to 400 site-based staff when the mine is fully operational.&rdquo; Lynham noted that it was not just the state&rsquo;s north-west which is set to benefit, with locals from Townsville with the relevant skills and experience also able to apply. &ldquo;MMG has identified Townsville as the fly-in/fly-out commute base for their additional workforce requirements.&rdquo; MMG is aiming to start construction of the Dugald River project by mid-year, and expects to employ about 600 staff during construction and 400 staff during the mine&rsquo;s operation. In April last year, MMG flagged a new mine plan for the Dugald River zinc/lead/silver project, based on a lower yearly throughput rate, which will allow for a longer mine life. The updated plan includes a mine production rate of 1.5-million tonnes a year, the construction of a concentrator and production of about 160 000 t/y of zinc-in-concentrate, plus by-products, over an estimated 28-year mine life. This compared with initial plans that saw the mine process an average of two-million tonnes a year of ore, to produce between 200 000 t/y and 220 000 t/y of zinc concentrate, between 27 000 t/y and 30 000 t/y of lead-in-concentrate and about 900 000 oz/y of silver.
