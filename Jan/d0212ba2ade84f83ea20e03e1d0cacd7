PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) has welcomed the Northern Territory government&rsquo;s decision to invest in a feasibility study to construct a common-user mine and processing facility in Tennant Creek. Chief Minister Michael Gunner earlier this week announced that the feasibility study would determine the viability of the common-user mine and facility, which would allow small mining operations to get under way without the need for major investment in processing solutions. AMEC CEO Simon Bennison said the decision showed the territory government recognised the long-term benefits the industry offered the Northern Territory. &ldquo;It is a fantastic outcome for those small miners who may just need that extra incentive to invest or expand in the Northern Territory,&rdquo; Bennison said. &ldquo;There is strong competition between Australian states and territories to attract the mining dollar and the opportunity to trim costs by using a common processing facility could make all the difference to where that dollar is spent. &ldquo;Mining is an important contributor to the Northern Territory, creating jobs, regional development and revenue streams for government.&rdquo;
