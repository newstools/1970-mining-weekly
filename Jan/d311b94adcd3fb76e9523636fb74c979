PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; South Africa-focused coal miner Universal Coal has produced the first run-of-mine coal from its New Clydesdale Colliery (NCC) opencast development. Universal said on Wednesday that opencast mining would ramp-up over the next quarter, reaching steady-state in the second half of 2017 and complementing the underground coal currently being mined from three underground sections at the adjacent Diepspruit shaft. &ldquo;With both NCC&rsquo;s underground and the opencast pit now being mined simultaneously, the colliery is set to contribute significantly to the cash flow that Universal currently receives from our Kangala colliery, and its exposure to the improved thermal coal export market will diversify our revenue,&rdquo; said Universal CEO Tony Weber. Opencast operations at NCC started in January as the second phase of the project&rsquo;s planned 3.3-million tonne a year run-of-mine development programme, following the start of underground operations in September last year. The third section of the coal handling and preparation plant, totaling an additional 100 t/h capacity, has been fully rebuilt and is currently being commissioned, bringing the net throughput capacity to 3.3-million tonnes a year. Meanwhile, all outstanding conditions precedent for the A$21-million NCC loan facility with Investec Bank has now been met, with the facility to fund the balance of the capital required for the development of the opencast mine and additional infrastructure, expansion of the coal handing and processing facility and general owners costs. The first draw-down of the facility will be issued before the end of April, and the first scheduled repayment date is for the end of April 2018.
