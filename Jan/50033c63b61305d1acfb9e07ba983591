LIMA &ndash; A third auction to find a new operator of Peru&#39;s nearly 100-year-old polymetallic smelter La Oroya failed to draw any offers on Thursday, but the government is planning to hold a new round of bidding before a liquidation deadline in August. Guillermo Shinno, the government representative in the auction, said four interested companies might have declined to make an offer because new air quality standards that could lower the cost of upgrades have not yet been published.
