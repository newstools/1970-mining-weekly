JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-V-listed Volcanic Gold Mines has completed almost 3 000 m of reverse-circulation and diamond drilling and over 6 000 m of air-core drilling at its Mandiana project and the recently acquired adjoining land from West African Mining Associates (Wama) in Guinea. This month, the company expects to embark on a high-resolution airborne magnetic survey flown at 50 m line spacing and low sensor clearance to obtain important targeting information associated with known mineralised trends. &ldquo;As well as serving to infill the mineral resource, the purpose of drilling is to gain vital information on the geological controls on mineralisation, as a basis for targeting further resource drilling activities later in 2017,&rdquo; Volcanic said in an update to shareholders on Friday. The company said RC drilling is also being advanced at the Farabakoura target at the Wama project to confirm high-grade historic results, while air-core drilling was ongoing to explore strike and lateral extensions to mineralisation to the north, east and south of the Yagbelen Resource and along a north-south axis at Farabakoura. &ldquo;Drilling is being performed in a series of fences established at 100 m to 200 m intervals, along which inclined holes are drilled at 40 m to 50 m spacings. This rapid, low-cost approach to exploration has been designed to provide detailed and accurate information on near-term resource targets,&rdquo; Volcanic concluded.
