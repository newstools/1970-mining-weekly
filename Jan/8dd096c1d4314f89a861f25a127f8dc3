PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Iron-ore prices could fall by as much as 30% or more, analysts Gavekal and HSBC have warned, prompting the Western Australian Chamber of Minerals and Energy (CME) to again warn about the consequences of implementing further taxes on iron-ore. CME CEO Reg Howard-Smith said this week that the warning further underscores the volatility of the iron-ore and resources sector and highlights the need for a considered, stable environment to enable the sector to operate and grow, creating jobs and opportunity along the way, as well as returning income to the state. &ldquo;These forecasts by world leading experts highlight the fact it would be foolish to bank on iron-ore prices staying at their current levels,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Unfortunately, plunges in the price of iron-ore is bad news for Western Australia&rsquo;s budget but it also highlights the fact that, if implemented, the mining taxes will [have an even greater] effect on investment into Western Australia and, therefore, result in job losses. &ldquo;With volatility on the horizon and challenges from global competitors ever present, the Western Australian Nationals&rsquo; proposed iron-ore tax is the single biggest economic threat to Western Australia&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo; Western Australian Nationals leader Brendon Grylls has proposed imposing a A$5/t iron-ore production levy on BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, to replace the current 25c/t payment. Both iron-ore majors have rejected the A$7.2-billion levy increase, warning that it would place jobs and competitiveness at risk.
