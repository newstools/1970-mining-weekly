VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will pay nearly C$1.2-billion to become the largest partner in the Corrib offshore natural gas field, 83 km offshore Ireland. The Toronto-based fund manager will initially buy a 45% interest in the project from a subsidiary of the Dutch exploration and production giant Shell for &euro;830-million. After that deal closes, CPPIB plans to transfer a 1.5% interest in the project to Calgary-based Vermilion Energy, for C$228.24-million. Vermilion currently holds an 18.5% working interest in the Corrib natural gas field. &quot;We welcome CPPIB as a strategic partner in this world-class gasfield, and we look forward to a productive long-term relationship.&nbsp; Our ownership in Corrib and investment in Ireland date back to 2009, and we are proud to be a part of the energy industry in this stable jurisdiction,&rdquo; Vermillion president and CEO Anthony Marino stated on Wednesday. Following the transactions, Vermilion will have a 20% interest in Corrib and be the operator. Norway&rsquo;s Statoil ASA would continue to have a 36.5% interest in Corrib and CPPIB will own the remaining 43.5%. The CPP Fund, managed by the CPPIB for the Canada Pension Plan, was worth about $316.7-billion as of March 31. Corrib will be managed by CPPIB&rsquo;s natural resources group, which had investments worth $4.3-billion as of March 31.
