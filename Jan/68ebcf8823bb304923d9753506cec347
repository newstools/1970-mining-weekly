VANCOUVER &ndash; Canadian miner Teck Resources does not expect a material impact on production at its Highland Valley copper unit because of unusual spring weather earlier in May, a spokesperson said on Wednesday. The Vancouver-based company said on May 7 that rapidly melting snow had caused water to flow into pits at the copper mine in Canada&#39;s British Columbia province, suspending some operations. Teck has been assessing the impact on production.
