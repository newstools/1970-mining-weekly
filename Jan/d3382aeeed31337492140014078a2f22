JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Tawana Resources has exercised its option to acquire 100% of four lithium tenements at its Western Australia-based Cowan and Yallari projects. The Cowan project comprises three tenements totalling 159 km2. The tenements are adjacent to and surrounded by Tawana&rsquo;s Bald Hill mine, where lithium production is expected to start this year. &ldquo;We are currently focused on drilling out a maiden lithium resource reserve at the Bald Hill mine, in Western Australia, in preparation for mining, and the neighbouring Cowan lithium project includes a significant portion of the same large rare metal pegmatite belt with targets for future resource drilling,&rdquo; MD Mark Calderwood said. The fourth tenement is a 41.2 km2 application which forms part of the company&#39;s Yallari project. No exploration for lithium has been undertaken to date; however, the project is considered highly prospective.
