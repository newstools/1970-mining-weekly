PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified miner South32 has struck a three-year strategic partnership with New York-listed GE to assist in the company&rsquo;s digital transformation. South32 said in a statement on Monday that it will use GE&rsquo;s Predix platform, designed to connect industrial equipment, data analysis and instant insights, to enable the company to make fast, informed decisions, and to provide the opportunity to optimise entire operations rather than individual assets and equipment. &ldquo;Bringing the world of operational technology and information technology together to monitor equipment and systems remotely and predict future behaviour is a game changer,&rdquo; said CEO Graham Kerr. &ldquo;It has the potential to identify and solve a problem before it affects an operation.&rdquo; This was GE&rsquo;s first partnership with an Australian mining company in the digital space. &ldquo;Mines collect terabytes of data today, but do not have the platform or solutions to provide real-time insights to deliver operational productivity,&rdquo; GE Mining CEO Scott Phillips said. &ldquo;Together, GE Mining and South32 have the opportunity to help solve these challenges in the mining sector. This is a very exciting time to be in mining,&rdquo; he added.
