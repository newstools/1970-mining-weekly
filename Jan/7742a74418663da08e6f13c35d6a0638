WINNIPEG, Manitoba (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-listed AuRico Metals has closed the acquisition of Kiska Metals, increasing its already strong royalty portfolio by six royalties to 17. Kiska is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of AuRico.&nbsp; The arrangement was approved by about 96.31% of Kiska security holders at a special meeting on March 1. A final order approving the arrangement was obtained from the Supreme Court of British Columbia on March 3. Kiska&#39;s portfolio is focused on the East Timmins and Boulevard properties, operated by Kirkland Lake Gold and Independence Gold, respectively. Further, Kiska&#39;s six wholly-owned exploration projects present organic royalty creation opportunities, AuRico pointed out. The asets are all located in North America. &quot;We are very pleased to close this accretive transaction which further broadens our royalty portfolio pipeline in North America and preserves our strong balance sheet. With a well-diversified portfolio of royalties in place and several key upcoming catalysts expected at Kemess in the near term, we remain very well positioned for an exciting year ahead,&rdquo; AuRico president and CEO Chris Richter commented. AuRico uses income from its royalty portfolio to advance its 100% interest in the Kemess property, in British Columbia. The Kemess project hosts the feasibility stage Kemess underground gold/copper project, the Kemess East exploration project, and the infrastructure pertaining to the past producing Kemess South mine. AuRico&#39;s royalty portfolio includes a 1.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on the Young-Davidson gold mine and a 2% NSR royalty on the Fosterville mine, as well as a portfolio of additional producing and preproduction royalty assets located in North America and Australia.
