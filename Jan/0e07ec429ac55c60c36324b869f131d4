LONDON &ndash; Anglo American is set to sell its first public bond since it was stripped of its investment-grade status in February 2016 following the capitulation of global commodity prices. The mining company started marketing a US dollar-denominated benchmark five-year deal at a yield of 4.25% to 4.375%, and a US dollar-denominated benchmark ten-year deal at 5.125% to 5.25% on Monday. &quot;It was a matter of time before they came back to the market, but they wanted to wait until sentiment had recovered from last week&#39;s volatility,&quot; a lead banker said. Anglo, rated Ba1/BB+, initially held investor calls two weeks ago. However, bankers on the deal attributed the recent dip in oil prices, which saw Brent futures fall to just above $50/bl on March 22 before recovering to above $53/bl, and a turn in sentiment in equities - the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.4% in March - as the reason Anglo delayed its market return, as well as the underperformance of peer company Glencore. Commodity trader Glencore&#39;s $1-billion ten-year bond was bid at a wide of 183bp over Treasuries last week, 13 basis points wider than where it priced on March 21, according to Tradeweb data. However, that bond has since recovered to a bid of 176bp over Treasuries on Monday afternoon. THE RETURN Anglo American&#39;s euro bonds lost up to 48 points when its relegation to junk 14 months ago initiated a bout of forced selling from investment-grade accounts. But its credit profile is looking brighter again. The company was upgraded by Moody&#39;s to Ba1 with a positive outlook earlier last month, from Ba2, to reflect its improving credit profile and accelerated debt reduction, the agency said. S&amp;P also has a positive outlook on its BB+ rating. Anglo American paper has subsequently recovered strongly. Its &euro;750-million 3.25% Apr 2023 bond is bid at a cash price of 106.05, compared with lows of 59 in January 2016, according to Tradeweb. Anglo American has been de-leveraging its balance sheet since early 2016. In February of that year, it bought back around &euro;1.6bn-equivalent of short-dated euro, sterling and US dollar bonds, which cut its debt pile by $190-million. Anglo conducted a liability management exercise last month to buy back more of its euro, sterling and US dollar notes in a bid to reduce its net debt. Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS are active bookrunners on today&#39;s deals. BMO, Mizuho, Santander and SMBC are passive bookrunners.
