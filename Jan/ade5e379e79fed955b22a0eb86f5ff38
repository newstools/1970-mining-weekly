PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mining major BHP has confirmed that it is pursuing environmental approvals to develop two satellite pits to support production from its Mt Keith operation, in Western Australia. Mt Keith is owned by the Nickel West division of BHP. &ldquo;We are currently pursuing environmental approval as part of the study for the Mt Keith satellite project to provide BHP Billiton Nickel West with development options and maintain production for the future. &ldquo;At the current rate of production, the resource supporting Mt Keith will need to be sustained from other ore sources at some stage over the next five years,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the company told Mining Weekly Online on Wednesday. &ldquo;Securing environmental approval for the proposed Mt Keith satellite project will help to ensure Nickel West has a strong future and will continue to make a significant economic contribution.&rdquo; The Mt Keith satellite project consists of two satellite pits, namely Six Mile Well and Goliath. BHP is hoping to start pit development in July 2019, pending approvals, with nickel production expected in early 2020. Last year, the miner revealed that it would be spending up to $2-million a month over 2016 and 2017 on maintenance and repairs of the Nickel West business.
