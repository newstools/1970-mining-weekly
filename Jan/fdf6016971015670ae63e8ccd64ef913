PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Capital costs for the Central Eyre iron project (CEIP), in South Australia, have been slashed by some $295-million, from $4-billion to $3.7-billion. ASX-listed Iron Road told shareholders this week that the company&rsquo;s partner China Railway Group Limited (CREC) had delivered the capital savings as part of the joint project commercialisation programme, with further savings expected from a final mine plan and schedule review. CREC&rsquo;s cost reductions were primarily driven by the Chinese company&rsquo;s in-house procurement systems and leverage associated with key capital items and equipment required, Iron Road said. The CEIP is expected to produce about 20-million tonnes a year over a mine life of at least 30 years, with CREC expected to take some 10-million tonnes a year of concentrate from the project, with the Chinese partner also having proposed an equity investment at both company and project levels.
