PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified metals miner Metals X has taken the first steps to transforming the Nifty copper operation, in Western Australia, into a large, long-life and profitable asset. The ASX-listed company has reported a 59%, or 56 700 t, increase in the contained copper-in-ore reserve at the Nifty project, following additional drilling. The total ore reserve estimate is now at 9.75-million tonnes, grading 1.58% copper for 153 500 t of copper, compared with the previous ore reserve of 97 000 t of copper. The increased ore reserve means an additional five years of underground mine life, based on the current production rates, and an additional four-year mine life based on the 2018 targeted production rate of 40 000 t/y of copper-in-concentrate. The project is estimated to host a total mineral resource of 54.8-million tonnes, at 1.41% copper for 770 000 t of copper. &ldquo;Metals X is very pleased to release its first mineral resource and ore reserve estimates for the Nifty copper operation, which now stand at five years of reserves and 20 years of resource,&rdquo; said MD Warren Hallam. &ldquo;Drilling has also already identified significant extensions to the east and west of the Nifty orebody, which will be incorporated into a proposed further upgrade of resource and reserve estimates later in the year.&rdquo; Metals X acquired the Nifty project from fellow listed Aditya Birla in August of last year.
