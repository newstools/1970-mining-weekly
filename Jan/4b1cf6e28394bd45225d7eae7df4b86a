LIMA &ndash; Peru&#39;s economic output grew 0.71% in March compared with the same month a year earlier, beating expectations in a Reuters poll for a contraction of 0.5%, the government&#39;s national production indicator showed on Monday. It marked the smallest annual gain since November 2014, the national statistics institute Inei said. Economic output also fell 0.4% in March, compared with February, the third straight month-on-month decline. On Friday, the Economy Ministry said in a statement it was expecting year-on-year growth of around 0.5% in March. Heavy rainfall and flooding in the country&#39;s northern regions were major factors curbing growth, Inei director Anibal Sanchez Aguilar said. The mining sector fell 2.7% in March, compared with a year earlier, due to the unfavourable weather and a three-week strike at the Andean nation&#39;s biggest copper mine, Freeport-McMoRan&#39;s Cerro Verde, he added. Peru is the world&#39;s second-largest copper producer. Economic output grew 2.08% in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the same period last year, Inei added.
