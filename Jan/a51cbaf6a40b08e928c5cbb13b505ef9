PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Southern Gold is actively reviewing a number of scenarios for the development of an underground mine at the Cannon project, in Western Australia. The company said that an experienced mining executive has been appointed to review different development scenarios, to determine if a sustainable underground operation can be developed on the high-grade Cannon shoots identified up to 80 m below the base of the current openpit operation. Results of the review, which would include deeper drilling below the currently defined resource envelope, as well as any potential commercial arrangements around a preferred development scenario, will be announced over the next few months, Southern Gold said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the next processing campaign at the Cannon openpit is expected to start in late June, and to deliver around 4 000 oz of gold.
