JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Underground development has started at TSX-V- and Aim-listed Galantas Gold&rsquo;s Omagh gold property, in Northern Ireland. &quot;This is an important milestone in the development of the Omagh underground gold mine. We are pressing ahead with mine development, in accordance with our planning permission,&rdquo; CEO Roland Phelps said in a statement. The initial works are for the formation of a portal in the western side wall at the base of the Kearney openpit. When the portal works are complete, the underground development will continue to access ore beneath a crown pillar retained in the base of the openpit. It is expected that ore zones are likely to be reached within six months. &ldquo;So far, we have boosted our local workforce to 17, including some former colleagues, who were previously laid off during planning delays,&quot; he said.
