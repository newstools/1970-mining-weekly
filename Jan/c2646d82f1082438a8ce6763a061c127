PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Dual-listed gold miner Chalice Gold Mines has set aside A$7.5-million for the exploration of five gold and base metals projects in Canada and Australia in 2018. Some A$5-million of the budget will be allocated to the East Cadillac and Kinebik gold projects, in Canada, with a further A$2.5-million allocated across the projects in Australia. &ldquo;Chalice has systematically assembled a global exploration portfolio that offers outstanding potential for new discoveries in some of the best exploration addresses in the world,&rdquo; said MD Tim Goyder. &ldquo;It is now time to evaluate the potential of this portfolio and we are in the enviable position of having the balance sheet and the in-house technical expertise to support a midtier-scale exploration effort without diluting our shareholders at the company or project level.&rdquo; Chalice has a balance sheet of A$53-million in cash and liquid assets.
