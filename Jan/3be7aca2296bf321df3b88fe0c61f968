PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The board of ASX-listed Cradle Resources has urged shareholders to accept a A$55-million takeover offer from joint venture partner Tremont Investments. Tremont, which holds a 50% interest in the Panda Hill niobium project, in Tanzania, was offering Cradle shareholders 33c in cash for each Cradle share. The offer price represented a 43.5% premium to Cradle&rsquo;s last closing price and a 37.3% premium to the company&rsquo;s 20-day volume weighted average share price. &ldquo;This is a compelling proposal and provides Cradle shareholders with the opportunity to realise a significant premium,&rdquo; said Cradle chairperson Ian Middlemas. &ldquo;The all-cash offer of 33c a share provides Cradle shareholders with certainty of value and an opportunity to realise their investment in full for cash. Tremont&rsquo;s management team shares our vision for the development of the Panda Hill niobium project and, as such, we believe they are the right long-term partner for future customers, employees and other stakeholders in this capital intensive project.&rdquo; Cradle and Tremont have now entered into a scheme implementation agreement, subject to a number of conditions, including shareholder and Federal Court approvals, as well as regulatory approvals. The Panda Hill project is expected to produce some 1.3-million tonnes of ore in its first four years of production, with output doubling to 2.6-million tonnes from year five. The project will have average life-of-mine production of 5 400 t/y of niobium, and has an estimated pre-tax net present value of $796-million. The Panda Hill project is expected to require a capital spend of $196-million to develop.
