PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Uranium developer Bannerman Resources has entered into a subscription agreement with Namibian company One Economy Foundation, which will become a 5% loan-carried shareholder in the Etango project. As part of the subscription agreement, Bannerman will issue 5% of its ordinary share capital to the not-for-profit organisation. The One Economy Foundation will be loan carried for all future project expenditure, including pre-construction and development expenditure, with the loan capital and accrued interest repayable from future dividends. Bannerman CEO Brandon Munro on Tuesday said the Namibian ownership cemented a key pillar of Bannerman&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility in that country. &ldquo;The One Economy Foundation&rsquo;s mission and approach is closely aligned with Bannerman&rsquo;s record as a leader in corporate social responsibility. &ldquo;Further, this initiative is closely aligned with the Namibian government&rsquo;s poverty eradication objectives under the Harambee Prosperity Plan and associated role that the Ministry of Mines and Energy is playing in this regard,&rdquo; said Munro. Based on average yearly production of 7.2-million pounds of uranium oxide over an initial mine life of 15.7 years, the Etango project is expected to have a net present value of $419-million and a post-tax internal rate of return of 15%. A definitive feasibility study estimates the project will cost about $870-million to develop.
