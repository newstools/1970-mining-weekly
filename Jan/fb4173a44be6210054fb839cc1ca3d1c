PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified miner Glencore has made a surprise $2.5-billion bid for miner Rio Tinto&rsquo;s 100% interest in its Coal &amp; Allied subsidiary, rivalling a bid from ASX-listed Yancoal which launched a $2.45-billion offer in January. Glencore&rsquo;s offer consisted of $2.05-billion in cash and $500-million in aggregate deferred cash payments, which will be payable as yearly installments of $100-million over five years, following the completion of the transaction. Coal &amp; Allied is the holding company for Rio&rsquo;s thermal coal business in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. It holds a 67.6% stake in the Hunter Valley Operations mine, an 80% stake in the Mount Thorley mine and a 55.6% stake in the Warkworth mine, as well as a 36.5% interest in Port Waratah Coal Services, which owns a coal export terminal at the Port of Newcastle. The Coal &amp; Allied assets lie adjacent to a number of the company&rsquo;s own coal mines in the Hunter Valley, including the Ravensworth North and the Bulga mines. Glencore said that the Coal &amp; Allied assets would allow the major to unlock large-scale mining and operating synergies, and that combined the portfolio of mines in the Hunter Valley would have a production capacity of some 81-million tonnes a year. Yancoal&rsquo;s offer, which the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approved in April, consisted of an initial $1.95-billion cash payment upon the completion of the transaction in the second half of 2017, followed by $500-million in deferred cash payments to be settled in five yearly installments of $100-million. Yancoal in May also offered $710-million to Coal &amp; Allied&rsquo;s joint venture (JV) partner Mitsubishi Development for its 32.4% interest in the Hunter Valley operation, fulfilling its obligation to the JV partner under the sale and purchase agreement with Coal &amp; Allied. Glencore has now also agreed to purchase Mitsubishi&rsquo;s 32.4% interest in the Hunter Valley operation JV and its 28.898% interest in the Warkworth JV for $920-million cash conditional on completion of its acquisition of Coal &amp; Allied, with $520-million being payable on completion and $100-million payable on the first four anniversaries of completion. Rio Tinto has acknowledged receiving the Glencore offer, telling shareholders that the company&rsquo;s board and management would give the proposal &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; consideration.
