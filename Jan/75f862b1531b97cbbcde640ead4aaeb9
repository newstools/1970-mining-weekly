PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Rare earths developer Northern Minerals has entered into a sales agreement with China&rsquo;s Lianyugang Zeyu New Materials Sales Co (JFMAG) covering all planned production from the Browns Range pilot plant, in Western Australia. The proposed pilot plant is a tenth of the scale of the full operation, and has a 60 000 t/y crushing beneficiation circuit, and 3 200 t/y hydrometallurgical plant, which will produce 590 t of total rare earth oxide in a mixed rare earth carbonate. The pilot plant is scheduled to operate for three years, during which time Northern Minerals will take a decision to commit to the full-scale operation. Under the terms of the sales agreement, and prior to the first shipment of rare earth carbonates, JFMAG will make a pre-payment of A$10-million, which will cover some 15% of the expected value of production during the pilot plant phase. The remaining 85% will be paid over the course of the agreement, based on volumes delivered. Furthermore, JFMAG or its nominated beneficiary, will be issued with 40-million unlisted options in Northern Minerals, priced at 25c each, which can be converted into ordinary shares to offset the pre-payment of the A$10-million. Following the execution of the sales agreement, Northern Minerals will issue 14-million shares to JFMAG or its nominated beneficiary. Northern Minerals MD George Bauk said on Thursday that the milestone sales agreement underpinned the Browns Range pilot plant development. &ldquo;The excellent terms we have agreed provide us with a transparent pricing mechanism and guaranteed demand for our product. The sales agreement is one of the final milestones that now allows us to move towards a final investment decision,&rdquo; he said. JFMAG is 51% held by Guandong Rare Earths Group, which in turn is a subsidiary of Guandong Raising Asset Management.
