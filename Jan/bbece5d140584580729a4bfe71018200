JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Dual-listed gold streaming and royalty firm Sandstorm Gold has completed its $175-million acquisition of Australian gold explorer Mariana Resources, which has now become a wholly owned subsidiary. The total consideration paid included 32.83-million new Sandstorm shares issued and a cash consideration of $48-million. As part of the acquisition, Sandstorm will add Mariana&rsquo;s Turkey-based Hot Maden anchor asset to its portfolio, which is expected to increase Sandstorm&rsquo;s attributable gold equivalent ounces to more than 135 000 oz by 2022, as well as increase operating cash flow to more than $100-million &ndash; based on a $1 250/oz gold price. Meanwhile, a preliminary economic assessment projected an after-tax net present value and an internal rate of return for Sandstorm of $1.37-billion and 153% respectively, with estimated all-in sustaining costs of less than $400 /oz. The acquisition of Mariana will also include exploration properties in C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire, Turkey and Argentina. Sandstorm has already begun the process of spinning out their exploration properties into a separate public company, with plans to retain net smelter return royalties and equity. The spin-out process is expected to be completed in six to 12 months and has the potential to add incremental value to the acquisition. &ldquo;This deal is truly transformative for the company. Hot Maden is one of the highest-grade undeveloped projects in the world. . . Opportunities to acquire anchor assets like Hot Maden are rare and, with the exploration potential that we see on the property, we anticipate that our 30% interest will continue to grow in value over time,&rdquo; remarked Sandstorm CEO Nolan Watson.
