PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Artemis Resources has completed the commissioning of its Nickol River gold project, in Western Australia. The company on Tuesday told shareholders that 7 869 t of ore had been treated at the site, delivering 1 994 g of gold dore. The mining operation and the plant were still in the development phase, with Artemis saying that the company was now in the process of progressing towards the start of full mining operations, which would begin in the next few weeks, following the receipt of final regulatory approvals. Artemis will gradually increase the plant throughput from the average 900 t/d achieved over the last week, to full-scale mining throughput of between 1 800 t/d and 2 000 t/d. Cash operating costs from the last nine days have averaged at about A$1 557/oz, while cash operating costs have been fixed at between A$14 260/day and A$16 600/day, depending on trucked tonnage moved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to report that Nickol River is now up and running through this lengthy set-up and development phase, and is now finally achieving operating cash costs below the current Australian gold price,&rdquo; said Artemis chairperson David Lenigas. &ldquo;This project has extremely low fixed operating costs of between 8.6 oz/d to 10 oz/d and our focus is to now increase plant throughput considerably over the coming months as the project gains all the necessary mining and processing permits that are in the pipeline.&rdquo;
