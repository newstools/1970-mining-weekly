PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified mining giant BHP Billiton has announced a major rebranding as part of a campaign to demonstrate the group&rsquo;s commitment to Australia. BHP Billiton is changing its name back to BHP, as part of the &lsquo;Think Big&rsquo; advertising campaign, which chief external affairs officer Geoff Healy said would demonstrate the role BHP played in the Australian economy and community and more broadly in global economic growth and development. The mining company started out as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, or BHP, in 1885 and retained that name until it merged with Billiton in 2001. The rebranding comes as BHP is defending itself against activist US fund manager Elliot Associates, which is urging the group to drop its dual-listed structure in Australia and the UK. Healy said that in launching the &lsquo;Think Big&rsquo; campaign, BHP would take the opportunity to change its logo and move to a brand that Australians have known for generations; BHP. &ldquo;This abbreviated simple expression of our organisation is used colloquially around the world,&rdquo; he added. The initial campaign includes two 30 second TV commercials, which will be accompanied by print and online advertisements and leveraged through social media. As the campaign progresses, the materials will grow and evolve. Think Big will also be launched globally in a phased approach into other markets where BHP is located. &ldquo;The advertisements will talk about the importance of our Australian heritage, our contribution and our commitment to communities where we operate. The campaign will focus on what people can and should expect of us,&rdquo; said Healy.
