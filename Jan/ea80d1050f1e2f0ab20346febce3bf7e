SINGAPORE &ndash; Iron-ore forecasts at Morgan Stanley have been chopped back for the remainder of the year, with the bank flagging prospects for rising low-cost production and the likelihood that the worldwide surplus will increase every year through to 2021. The commodity will average $50 a ton in the third quarter, 23% down from an earlier estimate, and $55 in the final three months, a 15% reduction, according to a report. The 2017 forecast was pared 15% to $63, while the outlooks for next year and 2019 were left at $58 and $54. After the commodity&rsquo;s second-quarter retreat, &ldquo;all market signals suggest trade stability at this level,&rdquo; analysts including Tom Price said in the note, which was received on Tuesday. The bank, which listed iron ore among metals on which it&rsquo;s neutral, said Vale SA&rsquo;s ramp up of new mine S11D in Brazil is behind a surplus, capping spot prices, despite robust or stable demand. Iron ore prices that peaked near $95 in mid-February have sunk since then amid rising supplies from producers including Brazil&rsquo;s Vale, and as China&rsquo;s moves to clamp down on leverage helped to quell speculative trading. On Monday, BHP Billiton, the world&rsquo;s largest mining company, also highlighted new supply now flowing out of Brazil, predicting a drop in market volatility. &ldquo;We forecast an expanding surplus for seaborne trade, but a flat price of $55 to $60 expecting the majors to under-deliver on our forecast supply growth,&rdquo; Morgan Stanley said. The seaborne glut is seen rising from 34-million tons this year to 81-million in 2018, and reaching 185-million by 2021. Ore with 62% content delivered to Qingdao jumped 5.2% to $59.70 a dry ton on Tuesday, paring a quarterly decline, according to Metal Bulletin. The increase was preceded by a gain in futures, with the SGX AsiaClear contract in Singapore advancing 6.4%. BOOST EXPORTS Vale began commercial shipments from S11D in the first quarter, with the ramp-up to 90-million tons of capacity being spread over four years. That&rsquo;ll help boost exports from the miner to 361-million tons at the end of the decade from an estimated 319-million this year, according to Morgan Stanley. The view from Morgan Stanley compares with the outlook from Citigroup, which sees prices at $51 in the third quarter and $48 in the final three months after cutting its forecasts earlier this month. Citigroup puts the surplus at 118-million tons in 2017, up from more than 60-million tons last year.
