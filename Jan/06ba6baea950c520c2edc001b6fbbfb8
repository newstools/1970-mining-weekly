VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Project developer Alderon Iron Ore has appointed 30-year Newfoundland and Labrador government veteran Gary Norris as its new executive VP for government and community affairs, with immediate effect. The TSX-listed company, which is focused on its flagship Kamistiatusset (Kami) high-grade iron-ore property, located in the high-grade Labrador Trough, announced on Thursday that Norris would work closely with local, provincial and federal governments as well as various stakeholders throughout the region as the Kami project advances. &quot;With the first phase of our Kami Project reboot now completed, we are turning our focus towards reassembling the owner&#39;s team to take advantage of improving market conditions and advance our project to the next stage of development,&quot; stated chairperson and CEO Mark Morabito. Norris spent more than 30 years working for the Newfoundland and Labrador government, including as the clerk of the executive council and secretary to cabinet. He also held several other senior executive positions, including assistant deputy minister of environment and deputy minister of intergovernment affairs secretariat. Norris rejoins Alderon after tumbling iron-ore prices halted the Kami project in its tracks. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Economics from Memorial University of Newfoundland.
