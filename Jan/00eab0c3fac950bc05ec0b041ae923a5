TORONTO &ndash; Activist investor Carl Icahn reduced his stake in Freeport-McMoRan, the world&#39;s biggest publicly traded copper miner, to 6.33% as of June 6, from 7.2% in late November, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. In 2015, the billionaire investor took a large stake in the Phoenix, Arizona-based company, saying Freeport was undervalued. Last year, Freeport pledged to cut its debt in half, and is now very close to that target with &quot;a bit over $11-billion in net debt,&quot; CFO Kathleen Quirk said via webcast a Deutsche Bank conference this week. Its debt load had ballooned to $20.1-billion at the end of 2015, reflecting two big oil and natural gas acquisitions. To reduce the debt, Freeport sold assets valued at more than $6-billion in 2016. Icahn held 91.6-million Freeport shares as of June 6, a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed. Based on Freeport&#39;s closing stock price of $12.36 in New York, that holding is worth approximately $1.13-billion. In a November 23 filing, Icahn disclosed that his stake had dropped to about 7.2%, or 104-million shares, from an 8.8% holding previously.
