SANTIAGO &ndash; State copper commission Cochilco forecast on Thursday that Chile would produce slightly less than 5.6-million tonnes of copper in 2017, down from a previous forecast of 5.79-million, due largely to a strike at BHP Billiton&#39;s Escondida mine. The walkoff at Escondida, where workers downed tools for 43 days in the first quarter, chopped 180 000 t off the commission&#39;s previous estimate in January, Cochilco said in its quarterly report. Cochilco&#39;s estimate for 2017 production represents a 0.8% increase over 2016. &quot;An important part of that increase can be attributed to the low base of comparison of 2016 when Chilean production registered a decrease of 3.8%,&quot; Cochilco executive VP Sergio Hernandez said in a statement. The commission estimated copper prices would average $2.60 in 2017, up from a previous forecast of $2.40, due to tighter supply. In particular, the body cited stoppages at Escondida, the world&#39;s largest copper mine, as well as at Freeport-McMoran Inc&#39;s Grasberg mine in Indonesia and Cerro Verde mine in Peru. For 2018, Cochilco estimated that global copper prices would level out at $2.60/lb. &quot;This combination of disruptions generated expectations that during 2017, the refined copper market would present a deficit, bringing about an upward turn in the price,&quot; Chile&#39;s mining minister Aurora Williams said in a statement. Worldwide copper production would likely grow 0.7%, down from Cochilco&#39;s previous forecast of 2.9%, she said.
