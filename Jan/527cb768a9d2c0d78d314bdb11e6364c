PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The joint venture (JV) partners for the Waitsia Stage 2 gas project, in Western Australia, have short-listed four contractors to compete in a design competition for the front-end engineering design for the project. The Stage 2 design would include a gas plant capable of processing 100 TJ/d, carbon-dioxide extraction, collection hubs and flow lines, ASX-listed AWE said on Thursday. The design competition would allow the JV partners to establish a high degree of capital cost certainty and would also develop and compare engineering, procurement and construction and build-own-operate contracting models. AWE is hoping to complete all phases of the design by the end of 2017, prior to achieving a final investment decision on the Stage 2 project. &ldquo;Waitsia Stage 2 has been making excellent progress and the JV&rsquo;s decision to begin the design competition is another sign that this project is rapidly gaining momentum,&rdquo; said AWE CEO and MD David Biggs. AWE and its JV partner Origin Energy are targeting a final investment decision on Waitsia Stage 2 by the end of this year, and first gas from the project is targeted for 2020. Biggs, meanwhile, said that AWE was also drilling Waitsia 3 appraisal wells, and was negotiating sales arrangements with a number of potential customers.
