JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Michael Nott will step down as CEO of Aim-listed Alba Mineral Resources, effective June 1. He will, however, remain on the company&rsquo;s board as nonexecutive director. &ldquo;The board is really very grateful for the tireless effort and devotion to Alba shown by Mike during his stewardship of the company over the past several years. &ldquo;He joined the board on September 1, 2006 and, during his time as CEO, we have acquired a significant position in the UK onshore oil and gas sector, as well as securing ownership of the Amitsoq former graphite mine in Southern Greenland, a project for which the board has very high hopes,&rdquo; commented Alba chairperson George Grangeskides. Alba last week reported that it had completed consultations with the Greenland Mineral and Licensing Safety Authority, allowing it to embark on an exploration work programme at Amitsoq. The company also holds a 50% interest in Mauritania Ventures, which explores for uranium in Mauritania, and owns an exploration licence within the Limerick basin, in Ireland, that is highly prospective for zinc, lead and silver.
