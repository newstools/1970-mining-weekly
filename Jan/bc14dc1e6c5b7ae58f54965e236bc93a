PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; South Africa-focused West Wits Mining has selected a second surface project for development at its Soweto cluster gold project, in Gauteng. The ASX-listed company told shareholders on Tuesday that the Main and South Reef (M&amp;S) project had been selected as the second project to be developed in the pipeline of five or six surface opportunities at the Soweto project. The M&amp;S project forms part of West Wits&rsquo; broader strategy of developing a number of surface opportunities providing cash flow to further expand the company&rsquo;s resource from 1.37-million ounces, as well as to develop a larger mine plan, with the aim of sustaining the production of 100 000 oz/y for a minimum of ten years. &ldquo;The selection of M&amp;S is the result of a continuing review of the large pipeline of opportunities which the Soweto cluster hosts. We intend to progress the development of M&amp;S quickly and are in active discussions with potential contractors who have the necessary expertise and capacity,&rdquo; said chairperson Michael Quinert. &ldquo;We are aiming to be in a position to execute a heads of agreement in the near term.&rdquo;
