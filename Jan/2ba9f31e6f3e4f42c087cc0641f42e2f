JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash;&nbsp;A study by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland has determined that the Dundas province, in Greenland, where Aim- and FSE-listed Bluejay Mining&rsquo;s Pitiffuk titanium project is located, represents a significant ilmenite province. The provincial level study estimates ten-billion tonnes of ilmenite exists in the original rock, with up to seven-billion tonnes of mechanically eroded primary ilmenite made available for placer deposition. Although these volumes are non-Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant, it does indicate that the province could become home to multiple ilmenite operations. &quot;The Dundas titanium province is a new concept in the raw materials community. Bluejay has tenure over the natural pathway to the development of this newly identified titanium province through Pituffik and has the first mover advantage in this exciting region,&rdquo; Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree said on Monday. He added that the company is now focused on finalising a feasibility study at Pitiffuk. &ldquo;Additionally, we are currently in discussions with a potential offtake partner that will facilitate our move towards production in 2018.&quot;
