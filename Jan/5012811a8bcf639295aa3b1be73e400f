VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Operations at Canadian intermediate gold producer New Gold&rsquo;s Peak Mines, in New South Wales, Australia, have been temporarily suspended after a contract worker died after working underground on Monday. According to an announcement by the company on Tuesday, the worker on Monday indicated he was feeling ill while working underground. The individual was brought to surface and treated by the mine&#39;s emergency response team before being transported by ambulance to the Cobar hospital, where he later passed away. Operations at the Peak Mines have been suspended to allow for further investigation of the incident, New Gold stated. The Peak Mines, comprising four commercially active mines and a copper/gold processing plant, produced 107 000 oz of gold in 2016, and 15-million pounds of copper. New Gold&rsquo;s 2017 guidance calls for the mines to produce 85 000 oz to 95 000 oz gold and about the same volume of copper as in 2016.
