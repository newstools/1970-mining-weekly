BUENOS AIRES &ndash; Lithium production in Argentina is on track to reach 145 000 t in 2022, from 29 000 t produced in 2016, thanks to new investment plans, the Energy and Mining Ministry said in a report on Tuesday. Argentina is the world&#39;s No 3 producer of lithium, a hotly demanded material used in car batteries and mobile phones. The country currently produces around 16% of global output. &quot;There are several projects at different stages of progress that could be operating in the next five years,&quot; the ministry said in the report. It said the investments total $1.5-billion. The report included a chart that projected production of more than 145 000 t of lithium in 2022. Investments listed in the report included the construction of a 50 000-t capacity plant at the Cauchari salt mine, in the northern province of Jujuy, by Lithium Americas. It also mentioned projects planned by Galaxy Resources and French company Eramet. Miners Enirgi Group Corporation and Orocobre will expand their production of lithium in Argentina with investments of $720-million and $160-million, respectively, Argentina&#39;s government said last month.
