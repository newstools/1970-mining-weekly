JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; TSX-listed Platinum Group Metals (PTM) and joint venture partner Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation have selected SFA Oxford to assess potential offtake options and commercial terms for the Waterberg platinum group metals (PGMs) project. SFA will assist in formulating a metallurgical processing strategy that will include identification of all mineral processing options, evaluating commercial terms, processing routes and specific smelter options. The work undertaken by SFA will add to the work being done by an independent engineering qualified person in these areas and is expected to make a significant contribution to the economics to be outlined in the definitive feasibility study that is in progress. Based on the company&rsquo;s completed prefeasibility study (PFS), the Waterberg project is expected to produce up to 285 000 t/y of concentrate at peak production, containing 80 g/t platinum elements, plus copper at between 1% and 9.2% and nickel at between 1.1% and 5%. Base metal levels for Waterberg similar to the common Merensky concentrate make it metallurgically desirable for blending with other high-chrome concentrates. The PFS estimated that Waterberg could produce 472 000 oz/y of palladium; about 6% of the world&#39;s palladium production in 2015. &quot;We look forward to working with the team at SFA to further delineate the unique value opportunities for the project. The anticipated scale of production at Waterberg will play a significant role in meeting demand for PGM metals going forward, particularly palladium,&rdquo; said PTM CEO R Michael Jones.
