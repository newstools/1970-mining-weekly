PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Processing at CuDeco&#39;s Rocklands copper project, in Queensland, is once again under way and ramping up to nameplate capacity. Mining will restart on March 15. The Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines in February temporarily suspended operations at Rocklands pending the submission of an updated safety and health management system, after a review found that the current systems were out of sync with activities taking place at the mine site. The suspension order was lifted on February 24 and operations restarted on the same day. Interim chairperson Peter Hutchison on Tuesday said that with mining restarting shortly, CuDeco was heading into a period of robust performance. &ldquo;Rocklands is a fantastic project that has every reason to be a highly successful producer. Since my appointment, I have met with senior Rocklands management and staff, and I am impressed with both their capability and commitment to the project,&rdquo; said newly appointed CEO Mark Gregory. &ldquo;With the right support and direction, I see no reason for the project to not only thrive but grow considerably,&rdquo; he added. Mining contractors have now been mobilised at Rocklands, and crushing plant capabilities are being increased to ensure nameplate capacity can be maintained. Meanwhile, a review of the health and safety management plan at Rocklands is continuing, with an external audit due by March.
