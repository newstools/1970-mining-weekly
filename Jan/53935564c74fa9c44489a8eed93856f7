VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Vancouver-based project developer Lithium X has raised gross proceeds of about C$15-million through a bought deal offering, which it will put to work at its flagship Sal de los Angeles lithium brine project, in Argentina. The junior offered 7.9-million common shares at a price of C$1.90 apiece, sold by a syndicate of underwriters led by Canaccord Genuity and GMP Securities. Lithium X plans to use the net proceeds of the offering to continue the development of Sal de los Angeles by completing a work programme aimed at updating the mineral resource estimate for the project; completing a feasibility study on the project; and building an initial ponding facility. The company also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds for general working capital purposes. Lithium X&#39;s joint venture (JV) with Salta Exploraciones, at the Sal de los Angeles project, has recently received permits to build an initial ponding facility. The initial ponding facility is designed for an output of about 2 500 t/y of lithium carbonate equivalent. The permits allow for the construction of brine collection, pumping, piping and ponding facilities comprising 62.6 ha of lined ponds, designed to produce a high-purity 5% lithium concentrate. The JV ponding facility will cover a maximum of 100 ha (about 1%) of the 8 156 ha of the Sal de los Angeles landholdings.
