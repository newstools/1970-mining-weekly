PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gas producer ExxonMobil has highlighted the opportunity for further investment in the Bass Strait, on the back of completing it&rsquo;s A$5.5-billion Kipper Tuna Turrum development. ExxonMobil Australia over the weekend unveiled the completion of its Longford gas conditioning plant, which will process gas from the Kipper Tuna Turrum development, supplying some 1.6-trillion cubic feet of gas to eastern Australia. &ldquo;The gas conditioning plant helps maintain current gas supply levels from Bass Strait, which has been producing for more than 40 years and providing energy to power the economy,&rdquo; said ExxonMobil Australia chairperson Richard Owen. &ldquo;This project is breathing new life into Bass Strait, and allowing us to continue what&rsquo;s been a tremendous record of providing domestic gas to south eastern Australia,&rdquo; Owen said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping this is just the start of being able to develop further resources in Bass Strait and essentially create Bass Strait 2.0. We recognise the significant amount of effort that has gone into the project, not just in terms of construction effort, but also the effort from technical, operations and maintenance side.&nbsp; We have a tremendous workforce here who have done great job in completing a complex project.&rdquo;
