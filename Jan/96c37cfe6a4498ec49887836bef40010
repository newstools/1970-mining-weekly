BUENOS AIRES &ndash; Argentina&#39;s industrial production turned positive in May, official data showed on Thursday, breaking a 15-month streak of declines and providing a glimmer of hope for the lacklustre economy four months before crucial midterm elections. The 2.7% increase in output versus May 2016 was below median expectations in a Reuters poll of analysts for a 3.5% increase. The positive reading was nonetheless welcome in a country hit by high inflation that has reduced domestic consumption and weakness in main trade partner Brazil. Industrial activity has fallen a cumulative 1.4% so far this year compared with the first five months of 2016, after a 4.6% decline overall last year. The turnaround, if sustained, could provide a boost to President Mauricio Macri&#39;s efforts to spur growth, seen at around 3% in 2017 by the government. Overall economic activity fell 2.2% last year but has grown 0.4% in the first four months of the year. Macri has been hard put to deliver on promises of attracting investment needed to get the economy moving ahead of the October mid-term vote, which will determine the power he will have in Congress to push through market-friendly reforms in the second half of his term. The rebound in industrial production in May was driven by a 17.4% year-over-year increase in the automotive sector and a 3.9% increase in food production. Output of steel and cement - crucial inputs for a fast-growing construction sector - also posted strong growth. Struggling industries such as textiles and tobacco continued to decline, falling 13.3% and 15.2%, respectively. May&#39;s official economic activity figures have not yet been released. The economy expanded by 0.6% in April, below expectations.
