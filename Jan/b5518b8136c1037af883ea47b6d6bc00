JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; With world diamond prices currently &ldquo;very unexciting&rdquo; and with stagnant growth forecast for jewellery sales, junior miners should think long and hard before investing in diamond exploration projects, as there is a risk of decreased investment from the market. Speaking at the Junior Indaba, in Johannesburg, on Thursday, Cadiz Securities economist Peter Major warned that the diamond mining industry was currently &ldquo;filled up&rdquo;. However, junior miner Botswana Diamonds CEO James Campbell disagreed. Speaking to Mining Weekly Online on the sidelines of the indaba, he noted that there was still steady growth in diamond demand. &ldquo;People haven&rsquo;t spent money on diamond exploration and, therefore, there are no new discoveries. The only one of note is Alrosa&rsquo;s Luaxe kimberlite, in Angola, but there aren&rsquo;t any more,&rdquo; he pointed out. The development of the newest diamond mine, a joint venture between Alrosa and Angolan national diamond company Endiama, was announced in May, with the deposit expected to be worth more than $35-billion. Meanwhile, Campbell pointed out that &ldquo;even the large majors&rdquo; were not spending too much money and have also not found recent new deposits. &ldquo;The older mines are becoming deeper and more expensive, so supply is plateauing and, in the next five years or so, it will drop off,&rdquo; he said. With diamonds being an aspirational buy and with a growing middle-class emerging in Asia &ndash; including China and India &ndash; Campbell forecast a widening supply and demand gap, which would lead to a steady rebound in the diamond price. He added that top-end producers, which deliver diamonds worth anything north of $100/ct, experienced much less volatility in diamond price growth. Asked how juniors would find new diamond pipes, Campbell said brownfield projects were often the most obvious places to start. &ldquo;However, there are many parts of the world where there hasn&rsquo;t been exploration or, if there was, it was 30, 40 or more years ago.&rdquo; Campbell said that, with the advent of new technology, a junior miner such as Botswana Diamonds was able to develop a &ldquo;billion-dollar asset&rdquo;, while a major miner &ndash; De Beers &ndash; &ldquo;walked away&rdquo;. Campbell was referring to the AK6 kimberlite project in Botswana, where the &ldquo;abundance&rdquo; of Type IIa and larger diamonds were inadequately considered in initial evaluations. &ldquo;The operating margins are significant, so it could have been a De Beers mine today,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Modern technology allows you to go back and look at those previously explored areas. If you look at the central Kalahari, [there is a revival] in diamond exploration,&rdquo; he noted, adding that Botswana Diamonds was also currently evaluating a kimberlite pipe in the region, which was discovered by another company. &ldquo;Using different technology, we found very different and very encouraging results. You have to be in the right place and have the right technology,&rdquo; said Campbell. Meanwhile, Major quipped that if there was a diamond mining company to invest in at the moment, it would be Botswana Diamonds, as &ldquo;they are selling us an option on what could be reality, an option without an expiry date and that is the kind of option I like to invest in&quot;.
