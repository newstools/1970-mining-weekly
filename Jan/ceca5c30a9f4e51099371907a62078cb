VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Canadian project developer Aquila Resources has received the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for its Back Forty zinc/gold project, in Michigan, representing a major milestone for the company. The NPDES was issued on Wednesday, following a comprehensive public commentary period that ended on November 3, 2016, and a review by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that was completed on February 24. &quot;Aquila is very proud of this milestone achievement given that the NPDES permit satisfies both state and federal regulators as it pertains to protecting the Menominee river and surrounding watershed. We will continue our efforts with Michigan and local communities to demonstrate our commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainable resource development that benefits all stakeholders,&rdquo; CEO Barry Hildred said. TSX-listed Aquila noted that the NPDES permit regulates the effluent limitations and monitoring requirements of water discharged to the Menominee river during mine operation. Aquila received the mining and air use permits on December 28, and is currently working with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to finalise the wetlands protection permit that is expected to be granted later this year. Aquila will, this year, focus on completing its feasibility study, finalising the two outstanding permits, expanding its owner&#39;s team and closing on financing that will fund the project through to commercial production. It also has plans to do more exploration, targeting a new mineralised zone, while also better defining the underground resource. Back Forty is a volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit located along the mineral-rich Penokean Volcanic Belt, in Michigan&rsquo;s Upper Peninsula. It currently has a compliant measured and indicated resource of 15.1-milion tonnes, containing close to one-million ounces of gold and one-billion pounds of zinc.
