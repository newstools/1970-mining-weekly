JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Former Rio Tinto executive Nigel Jones has joined the board of uranium developer Berkeley Energia as a nonexecutive director, the Aim- and ASX-listed company announced on Wednesday. London-based Jones has 30 years&rsquo; experience in the international mining sector and has corporate development and marketing expertise, including being responsible for the negotiation of key uranium supply agreements for Rio Tinto. Jones spent two decades at Rio Tinto, where ultimately he held the position of global head of business development, and prior to that MD of Rio Tinto Marine and head of investor relations and marketing director of uranium. Berkeley MD Paul Atherley commented that Jones&rsquo; appointment was in step with the company&rsquo;s transition into a European-focused uranium developer and producer. &ldquo;We believe his considerable experience in corporate development and marketing of uranium products will be of considerable value to the company.&rdquo; Jones is replacing Dr Jim Ross, who is retiring from the board after over 12 years. Berkeley is developing the Salamanca uranium project in western Spain. Construction has started and first production is scheduled for late 2018. The Salamanca project is expected to deliver about 4.3-million pounds a year of uranium oxide over a mine life of 18 years.
