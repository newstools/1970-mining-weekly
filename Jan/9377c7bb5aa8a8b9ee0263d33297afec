PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Dual-listed gold miner Perseus Mining has revised the expected mine life of its Sissingu&eacute; gold project, in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, from a previously expected 5.25 years to 5 years. Perseus has updated the life-of-mine plan for the Sissingu&eacute; gold project, following a re-estimation of the mineral resource and ore reserves, with the ASX- and TSX-listed company saying the mine will now produce some 358 000 oz over its five-year life. Around 80 000 oz/y will be produced in the first 3.25 years of production and a further 70 000 oz/y over the remainder of the mine life. Previous feasibility studies on the Sissingu&eacute; project had estimated a production of 385 000 oz of gold during a 5.25-year mine life, with an average of around 75 000 oz/y to be produced in the first five years. The same study had estimated that a capital investment of $106-million would be required to develop the Sissingu&eacute; project, but Perseus on Friday increased this to $107-million, with production costs reaching some $569/oz. The Sissingu&eacute; project was nearly 40% complete and is running on schedule for first gold production in the March 2018 quarter, Perseus said. The project development has been fully funded to completion through a combination of internal cash and bank provided debt financing.
