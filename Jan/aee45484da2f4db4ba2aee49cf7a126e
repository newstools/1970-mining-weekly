PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed gold developer Vango Mining has started its dewatering programme at the K2 underground gold mine, in Western Australia. &ldquo;We are delighted to be in a position to commence dewatering of the K2 deposit. Despite an extended period of heavy seasonal rain at the project area, we have been able to instigate and embark on the dewatering progamme as per our operational timetable, which is particularly pleasing,&rdquo; said Vango executive chairperson Bruce McInnes. &ldquo;This will enable us to maintain our development schedule at K2, which remains on track to see Vango mining first ore in the third quarter of this year.&rdquo; Vango has received all approvals to start with the construction and commissioning of its dewatering programme, including the requisite work approvals from the Department of Environmental Regulation and approval of the mining proposal from the Department of Mines and Petroleum. Plant and infrastructure is currently being mobilised to site ahead of an eight-day establishment and commissioning period, with the dewatering activities set to take around 65 days. Vango on Wednesday said the dewatering programme will facilitate the inspection and assessment of the K2 decline as the water is removed, to determine what refurbishment work, if any, is required. It will also provide the company with access to the decline in order to conduct targeted drilling and preparatory activities for mining. The K2 deposit forms part of the larger Plutonic Dome project, which Vango acquired from Dampier Gold at the start of 2016, for A$6.2-million.
