PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Junior vermiculite miner ASX-listed Black Mountain Resources has completed its first sale, to a new customer, in Southern Africa. &ldquo;This first sale is a pleasing development for Black Mountain,&rdquo; said chairperson and CEO Julian Ford, adding that it demonstrated that there was a demand for the company&rsquo;s premium-grade larger flake vermiculite in Southern Africa, and that its Namekara project, in Uganda, could compete in a global marketplace. &ldquo;The Namekara mine and processing facility are performing well. We expect to shortly publish an initial reserve report, which then gives us significantly improved flexibility to report on production forecasts and plans,&rdquo; he added. The first vermiculite sale was undertaken on a trial basis and meant that Black Mountain had the opportunity to build stable sales channels.
