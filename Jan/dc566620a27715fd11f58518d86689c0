PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Victorian Parliament has passed the Resource Legislation Amendment (Fracking Ban) Bill 2016, permanently banning all onshore unconventional gas exploration and development. The Bill also extended the moratorium on conventional onshore gas exploration and development until the end of June 2020. &ldquo;This is a historic day for our state. We promised we would ban fracking &ndash; and that is exactly what we have done,&rdquo; said Victorian Resource Minister Wade Noonan. &ldquo;This is a win for people power and regional communities across Victoria who have campaigned for years to see this ban in place.&rdquo; &ldquo;We will now use the moratorium on conventional gas exploration to better understand its potential risks and benefits and we&rsquo;ll listen to the experts.&rdquo; The Minerals Council of Australia, however, lamented the passing of the Bill, with acting CEO for Victoria Gavin Lind saying the Victorian government and the opposition have conspired to raise energy prices for both businesses and households. &ldquo;[The] passing of the Resource Legislation Amendment (Fracking Ban) Bill 2016 proves both sides of politics are willing to sacrifice jobs and business investment for votes. Hydraulic fracturing is a known, safe and proven technology used in gas extraction in Queensland, South Australia and many jurisdictions overseas,&rdquo; Lind said. &ldquo;Victorians deserve better than mainstream political parties that perpetuate ignorance and disregard for science and long-held experience. &ldquo;What has been missed in the antiscience debate about gas extraction is the impact of locking up the state&rsquo;s gas supply on Victorian &ndash; and Australian &ndash; businesses and households.&rdquo;
