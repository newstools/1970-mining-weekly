JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash;&nbsp;Dual-listed Kibo Mining has received written reconfirmation from the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and Minerals (MEM) calling for expedited development of the Mbeya coal-to-power project (MCPP). &quot;We are pleased with the latest response from the MEM. The process of negotiating and agreeing a final power purchase agreement should now progress at a considerably faster pace than over preceding months, as this remains the key to completing development of the MCPP,&rdquo; CEO Louis Coetzee said in a statement on Thursday.&nbsp; He noted that Kibo was encouraged by the MEM&#39;s acknowledgement of the advanced development status of the MCPP and its key role as a strategic regional power hub. &ldquo;The MCPP is able to tackle the unique challenges faced by the Tanzania energy sector at all levels, thereby providing a catalyst for further economic development.&quot; MCPP entails the development of a coal mine, based on an existing coal resource of about 121-million tons, and a 250 MW to 300 MW mine mouth thermal power station.
