JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Aim-listed Firestone Diamonds has recovered a 110 ct gem-quality light yellow diamond &ndash; its largest diamond recovered to date &ndash; from the Liqhobong mine, in Lesotho. The discovery was made during the mine&rsquo;s ongoing ramp-up. &ldquo;The 110 ct gem-quality light yellow diamond recovered . . . confirms our long held belief that Liqhobong has large stone potential and I hope this is the first of many to come,&rdquo; Firestone CEO Stuart Brown said in a statement on Wednesday. Liqhobong is expected to reach commercial production at the end of June. Commissioning of the mine started in October 2016, with the mine construction completed on time and within the $185.4-million budget. Firestone held its first two sales in Antwerp, in Belgium, in February and March, with the latest sale having included an exceptional purple diamond, a blue diamond, a lilac diamond and several pink diamonds. The two sales generated proceeds of $13.7-million from the sale of 127 590 ct at an average price of $107/ct.
