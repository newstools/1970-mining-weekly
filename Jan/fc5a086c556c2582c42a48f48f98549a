PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Although mining and metal deal volumes in Australia rose by 41% year-on-year in 2016, the value of these deals fell by 73%, new research by advisory firm EY has revealed. Australian mining and metal deal value fell to $3.5-billion in 2016, EY&rsquo;s quarterly &lsquo;Mergers, Acquisitions and Capital Raising in the Mining and Metals Sector&rsquo; report found. This drop in value was slightly offset by the increase in transaction volumes, which rose from the 68 deals in 2015 to 96 deals. &ldquo;There was a lack of large assets available in 2016, as sellers were wary to transact while the resurgent coal price was driving up values. However, with a number of coal assets already listed in 2017, we can expect to see this trend reversed as sellers seek to capitalise on regional demand for high-quality Australian coal,&rdquo; said EY Oceania mining and metals transaction leader Paul Murphy. &ldquo;Globally, the shift towards energy policy, driven by clean coal, is a positive sign for the owners of Australian assets, as this will continue to generate strong demand for high-quality producers in the medium term.&rdquo; Meanwhile, EY reported that China had more than doubled the value of domestic and cross-border acquisitions in 2016, accounting for 19% of global deal volumes. Four of the top ten deals in the sector were undertaken by Chinese acquirers, and the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 49% of global deal volume. China Molybdenum&rsquo;s activities alone accounted for $4.3-billion worth of acquisitions, just under 10% of the overall deal value in the sector. In 2016, capital raised in China also doubled from the previous year, to $100-billion, due to a significant rise in domestic corporate bond issues. This masked an overall decline across the sector globally, with Chinese bond activity driving a 9% increase in total capital raised, to $249-billion. Excluding China, global capital raised declined by 16% to $149-billion. &ldquo;The Chinese market is maturing, moving from relatively indiscrete expansionary acquisitions, to activity driven by cost efficiency, vertical integration and portfolio optimisation,&rdquo; said Murphy. &ldquo;In 2016, this activity was concentrated on copper assets, with Chinese buyers seeking to shore up a more stable supply, despite record exports in the calendar year.&rdquo;
