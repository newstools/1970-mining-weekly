PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; A maiden mineral resource of 441 200 t, grading 3.02 g/t gold for 42 900 oz of gold has been declared at the Redback deposit, in Western Australia. ASX-listed Maximus Resources said on Monday that the Redback deposit, which is located some 600 m south of the previously mined high-grade Wattle Dam gold mine, showed several similarities with the Wattle Dam project, noting that they shared similar mineralisation and visible gold and high-grade assays. Wattle Dam produced 268 000 oz of gold between 2006 and 2013. The maiden mineral resource estimate at Redback was based on data from 91 reverse circulation and diamond holes drilled throughout 2014 and 2015. Maximus is now planning additional drilling to further evaluate the shallow oxide potential at Redback and better define the relationship with the nearby prospects. Drilling will also assist the company with potentially combining the prospects into a single larger project that will enable a more detailed assessment of the economics and combined tonnage and grade potential of multiple openpits.
