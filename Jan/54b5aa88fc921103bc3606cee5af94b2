The two companies in September last year agreed to form a JV, with Eastern Goldfields committing to spend up to A$7-million to gain an interest in the two gold projects, as well as taking an interest in Intermin. Eastern Goldfields will sole fund and manage A$5.5-million of exploration and development studies at the project areas over the next four years, to earn a 65% stake in the tenements. Eastern Goldfields executive chairperson Michael Fotios said on Thursday that the signing of the formal agreement completed the JV formalities. &ldquo;The deal has not changed from when we announced the signing of a heads of agreement. We are now excited by proceeding to undertake an earn-in to a potential 65% interest in the JV, which may include a feasibility study into the establishment of a second mine, potentially to be located in the Mt Ida/Menzies region.&rdquo; The tenements are estimated to contain nearly 200 000 oz of gold in reported resources, and have previously produced more than 830 000 oz, primarily from underground sources.
