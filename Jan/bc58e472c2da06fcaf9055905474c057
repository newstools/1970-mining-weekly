PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Poseidon Nickel has been given regulatory approval for lithium exploration at its Lake Johnston project, in Western Australia. The company on Friday said the departments of Parks and Wildlife and Mines and Petroleum have granted the necessary regulatory approvals, paving the way for Poseidon to start line access clearing at Lake Johnston&rsquo;s Medusa lithium project. Poseidon in October 2016 completed soil sampling and surface geochemistry analysis at Lake Johnston, identifying preliminary exploration targets. Aerial magnetic and radiometric surveys were applied to improve the exploration targets selected. Reverse circulation drilling will now be used to explore lithium-bearing pegmatites previously defined, with some 4 000 m to be drilled. The Lake Johnston project includes a 1.5-million-tonne-a-year processing plant that can process lithium-hosted pegmatite ores to produce a spodumene concentrate.
