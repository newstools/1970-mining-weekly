JAKARTA &ndash; US Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday he discussed with Indonesian President Joko Widodo barriers to US companies operating in Southeast Asia&#39;s largest economy. Pence arrived in Jakarta late on Wednesday to boost a strategic partnership between the world&#39;s second- and third-largest democracies, but a series of disputes Indonesia has had with American firms has ruffled ties. &quot;The President and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully,&quot; Pence told a round table discussion with business executives on Friday in Jakarta. Over the past six months, Indonesia has wrestled with mining giant Freeport McMoRan, demanding the company divest 51% of its shares in its Papua-based gold and copper mine, and has demanded that Google settle unpaid taxes of more than $400-million. Jakarta also scrubbed JP Morgan from its list of primary bond dealers after what was deemed a negative research report. Nevertheless, Pence was due to witness the signing of more than $10-billion in memoranda of understanding with US companies in Indonesia on Friday, a White House official said. The 11 deals would be signed with companies including Exxon Mobil, Lockheed Martin and General Electric. Pence is on the final day of a visit to Indonesia before departing at midday for Australia. &quot;We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia,&quot; Pence said. Lin Neumann, MD of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, said most of the agreements were with energy companies, which have been making &quot;a big push&quot;. Some US companies have a technological edge while Indonesia has a rising demand for power, &quot;so that&#39;s a good fit&quot;, Neumann told Reuters.
