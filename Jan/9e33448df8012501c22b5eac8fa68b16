JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Tharisa Minerals&rsquo; R303.3-million deal to acquire equipment and infrastructure from MCC Contracts has been approved by the Competition Commission. The companies entered into an agreement in May, with Tharisa intending to transition from a contract-mining to an owner-mining model through the acquisition of MCC&rsquo;s existing equipment, strategic components, site infrastructure and spare parts at the mine. The deal would also allow for the transfer of around 900 employees currently deployed at the mine. The deal includes 153 &lsquo;yellow fleet&rsquo; machines such as excavators, off-highway dump trucks, articulated dump trucks and support vehicles. &ldquo;By taking direct control of our mining operations, we will be better placed to control the reef grades, thereby delivering improved quality ore to the processing plants and optimising the feed and recovery within the plants,&rdquo; the miner said in May.
