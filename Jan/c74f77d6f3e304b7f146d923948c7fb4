JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Nordic-focused metals miner Bluejay Mining has finalised a field programme to refine the geological model of the Disko Nuussuaq project, in Greenland. Disko is a large-scale magmatic massive sulphide (MMS) target, which demonstrates many characteristics analogous to a flood basalt MMS polymetallic copper, nickel, platinum and cobalt mineralised system.&nbsp; The planned work programme is targeted for completion during the fourth quarter, once fieldwork at the company&#39;s Pituffik titanium project, is complete. Bluejay will conduct a high-powered, ground-based, electromagnetic survey (EM) for the purposes of identifying optimum drill site locations for a possible drilling programme during 2018. &quot;While the advancement of Pituffik remains our primary focus, Disko undoubtedly offers an extremely attractive development opportunity, and the chance to conduct this work to define drill targets during the 2017 season is far too great to miss, given our ability to leverage existing activities, which allows for significant cost savings,&rdquo; Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree said. He added that Disko has the potential to rival Russian miner Norilsk Nickel&rsquo;s Norilsk-Talnakh project, which is currently the largest nickel-copper-palladium deposit in the world. &ldquo;This is both in terms of size and grade and, having reworked all available historical data, it&#39;s a key part of our strategy to execute the ground-based EM to define optimum drilling locations. Work continues to realise value from the entire portfolio,&rdquo; he pointed out.
