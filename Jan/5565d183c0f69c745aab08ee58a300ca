TORONTO &ndash; Silver Wheaton would consider changing its financing deal with Primero Mining on the troubled San Dimas mine in Mexico if that would improve the &quot;health of the asset,&quot; the mining financier&#39;s CEO said on Monday. Silver Wheaton, a Vancouver-based company that provides miners with upfront payments, or &quot;streams,&quot; in exchange for future production at a discounted, fixed price, counts San Dimas as a key asset. Operations at the mine were suspended in mid-February after workers went on strike over contract changes proposed by the company to return it to profitability. &quot;If there&#39;s a way that we can change the agreement to improve the health of the asset, and we get compensated for fair value, then we&#39;ll explore that,&quot; Silver Wheaton CEO Randy Smallwood said in an interview at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference. He declined to say specifically how the agreement could be restructured. Toronto-based Primero has an agreement to sell Silver Wheaton the first six-million ounces of silver produced from San Dimas each year, plus half of any excess, at $4.20/oz, and an additional 1% for inflation. The deal continues to the end of the mine&#39;s life. Bank of Montreal analyst Andrew Kaip said in a recent note that the San Dimas represented some 15% of his 2017 revenue forecast for Silver Wheaton. Primero announced a cost-cutting program and strategic review to consider options such as asset sales after it said on February 23 that its chief executive was stepping down. &quot;There&#39;s no doubt that they&#39;ve got some challenges in front of them, but we&#39;re confident that if they sharpen their pencils, they can return to profitability,&quot; Smallwood said. &quot;This is an asset that&#39;s profitable, it&#39;s just had some burdens put onto it - some poorly timed investment decisions by Primero and a pretty heavy head office expense.&quot; Primero is also engaged in a tax dispute with the Mexican government, arguing that the country&#39;s tax authority is trying to retroactively change an agreement that the company had. Silver Wheaton is also focused on new deals, Smallwood said, as the mining sector transitions back into a growth phase. There are streaming transactions worth some $3-billion to $4-billion up for grabs, Smallwood said, but Silver Wheaton will pursue the more profitable deals worth about $1.5-billion to $2-billion.
