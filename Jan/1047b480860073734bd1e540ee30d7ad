PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Mining operations at the Tarcoola gold mine, in South Australia, have resumed following a temporary suspension in April. ASX-listed WPG Resources in April halted production at Tarcoola following two significant rainfall events, which closed roads leading into the mine, causing disruptions to potable water, diesel and supply schedules. WPG said on Tuesday that public roads leading to the Tarcoola site have been reopened and that scheduled deliveries have restarted. Drilling and mining activities have also restarted at the Tarcoola pit. However, the rail access corridor road has been the main focus of activities, with clearing and grading to continue over the next few days, WPG told shareholders. Two road trains are scheduled to haul material to the Challenger mine on Tuesday, and it is anticipated that the road will be fully operational for heavy vehicle access between Tarcoola and Challenger later in the week. Milling operations have meanwhile continued, with sufficient run-of-mine ore stockpiled at the Challenger mine.
