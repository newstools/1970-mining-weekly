TORONTO &ndash; Barrick Gold&#39;s near billion-dollar deal with Shandong Gold Mining represents a rich premium for the Canadian miner, while making good on a long-promised plan to forge deep, long-lasting partnerships with China. The sale of a 50% stake in Veladero, one of Barrick&#39;s top five gold mines, for $960-million is its biggest partnership deal with a Chinese miner, eclipsing a $298-million joint venture in 2015 with Zijin Mining Group for a mine in Papua New Guinea. The price tag, about 15% to 30% above some analysts&#39; net asset valuations, is a feather in chairperson John Thornton&#39;s cap, a former Goldman Sachs Group banker who has pledged closer ties with China since his 2014 appointment. &quot;Thornton is doing the right thing. He&#39;s put a billion dollars in our pocket and he has got the Chinese as partners. What more can you ask for?&quot; said billionaire investor Seymour Schulich. &quot;I like Thornton&#39;s style. He is well connected in China. The deals are finally starting to happen.&quot; Thornton, who lacks a mining background, spent years working in China after stepping down from a senior role at Goldman. He built a broad network of government and business connections in the country, where he taught at Tsinghua University&#39;s business school, a top institution whose alumni include presidents and premiers. Since a first meeting last April, Barrick and state-owned Shandong invested &quot;thousands of hours&quot; to get acquainted and form a partnership that Thornton expects to grow, he said in a statement. &quot;Today is the realisation of a China dream,&quot; he said. &#39;REAL PRIZE&#39; Toronto-based Barrick, which has sold a string of assets in recent years to cut a bloated debt load as commodity markets slumped, has been actively seeking joint venture partners to reduce risk and capital outlays while boosting expertise. But Thornton&#39;s challenges are far from over. The deal comes as Barrick, the world&#39;s largest gold miner, grapples with last week&#39;s pipe rupture at Veladero, the third incident at the mine in 18 months involving cyanide-bearing solution. Barrick&#39;s No 2 executive, president Kelvin Dushnisky, is in Argentina this week meeting with regulators, which on Wednesday rejected a work plan presented by Barrick. Analysts and investors say the deal&#39;s real prize is a plan to jointly study development of the long-stalled, massive Pascua-Lama project and neighbouring gold-rich deposits in the El Indio Belt. Straddling the border of Argentina and Chile, Pascua-Lama was put on hold in 2013 due to environmental issues, political opposition, labour unrest and development costs that ballooned to $8.5-billion. &quot;The bigger part of the deal today is possibly having a partner lined up for Pascua-Lama and being able to do that development, and maybe even having a broader reach,&quot; said Dan Denbow, senior portfolio manager at San Antonio-based USAA Investments, which holds some 700 000 Barrick shares. Barrick will use sale proceeds to cut debt, which it plans to reduce by more than a third to $5-billion by 2018. It will also invest in project development, a shift from previous years when deal proceeds were earmarked for debt reduction. The companies will also study ways to extend Veladero&#39;s mine life, which currently ends in 2024, said Barrick spokesperson Andy Lloyd. &quot;It&#39;s a huge positive. If they can monetise Pascua-Lama, it would be tremendous,&quot; said Schulich. &quot;Thornton wants to get cash flow, and this is just an opening step with the Chinese.&quot;
