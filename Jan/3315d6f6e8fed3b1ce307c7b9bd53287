SANTIAGO &ndash; Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said Thursday that she had asked state mining organisations including top producer Codelco to look at the possibility of building a new copper smelter to add value to copper exports. &quot;I have asked (the organisations) to begin a study together to establish a new smelter in the region of Atacama that will be at the vanguard of clean technology,&quot; said Bachelet, as she gave her annual state-of-the-nation address to Congress.
