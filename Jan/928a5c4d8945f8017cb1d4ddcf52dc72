JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; De Beers&rsquo; Forevermark diamond brand has inscribed its two-millionth diamond &ndash; a 3.48 ct round brilliant, bearing &lsquo;2,000,000&rsquo;. The diamond was mined, cut and polished in Namibia and inscribed at the Forevermark Diamond Institute in Surat, India. It will be set in a piece of jewellery at the Forevermark Design and Innovation Centre in Milan, Italy. The design will be worked on by the 2015 runner-up of De Beers Group&rsquo;s Shining Light Awards, Louise Kriek, from South Africa, under the Forevermark design team, as part of a three-month internship at Forevermark in Milan. The diamond will ultimately become part of Forevermark&rsquo;s exclusive red carpet collection, to be worn by celebrities at major events and award ceremonies around the world. &ldquo;The diamond&rsquo;s journey reflects our commitment to responsible sourcing, which involves tracing each diamond along its journey, ensuring strict business, environmental and social standards are met at every step,&rdquo; the group said in a statement. Forevermark CEO Stephen Lussier added that it also reflected the continued growth of the Forevermark brand, which has gone from &ldquo;strength-to-strength since launching nine years ago&rdquo;. &ldquo;This demand is being driven by consumers who want certainty that their diamonds not only possess the highest standards of beauty, but also come with the guarantee of being responsibly sourced. The unique inscription reflects the quality and rarity of each Forevermark diamond, as well as the stringent standards it meets as it makes its journey from mine to wearer.&rdquo; Each Forevermark diamond is inscribed with the Forevermark icon and a unique identification number. Invisible to the naked eye, the inscription is the Forevermark promise of beauty, rarity and responsible sourcing.
