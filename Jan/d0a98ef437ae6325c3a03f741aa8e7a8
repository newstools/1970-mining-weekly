JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; ASX-listed Cokal on Friday reported that coal production was imminent at its flagship Bumi Barito Mineral (BBM) Anak project, in Indonesia. Cokal is establishing a small-scale coal mining operation, which will produce a high calorific-value, high-volatility pulverised coal injection coal. Product coal will be sold to local companies for blending with their lower-quality coals. The mine is situated closely to the Barito river, requiring a short haul to the stockpile area. Cokal has acquired the relevant regulatory approvals, including the mining, environmental and forestry approvals from the various Indonesian government departments. It has&nbsp; successfully completed negotiations with the landowners and both parties are pleased with the outcome. Cokal has further negotiated terms for the supply of fuel, land-clearing contractors and a small fleet of mining and barging equipment.
